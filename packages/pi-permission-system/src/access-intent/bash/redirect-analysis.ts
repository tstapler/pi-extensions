 * What a redirect node in the parse tree proves.
 *
 * `command-effects.ts` owns the operator *table* — which spelling means read,
 * which means write — and this module owns reading a `file_redirect` node well
 * enough to consult it: finding the operator among the node's children, and
 * telling a destination that names a file from one that names a descriptor.
 *
 * The split exists because two callers need different answers from the same
 * read, and — importantly — they need them under different burdens of proof.
 * The token collector asks what effect to *attribute* to a destination it is
 * about to emit, so it answers with a proof. The command enumerator asks
 * whether it is safe to *remove* the wrapper floor, so it answers with a
 * refusal: anything it cannot resolve counts against the exemption (#803).
 * One reader of the node keeps the two from drifting on what a redirect is.

 * to remove a guard: `> $OUT`, `>${OUT}`, and `> $(mktemp)` name a file chosen
 * at run time, and the parse can say nothing about which. Reading those as "no
 * write proved, therefore no write" would hand the exemption to exactly the
 * shapes least visible to every other surface — the path projection does not
