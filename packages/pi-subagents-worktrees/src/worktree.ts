/**
 * worktree.ts — Git worktree isolation for subagents.
 *
 * Creates a temporary git worktree so an agent works on an isolated copy of the repo.
 * On completion, if no changes were made, the worktree is cleaned up.
 * If changes exist, a branch is created and returned in the result.
 * A worktree is only ever removed once its outcome is certain: when cleanup
 * fails partway, it is left on disk so the agent's work stays recoverable.
 *
 * Lifted from the pi-subagents core (Phase 16 Step 3, ADR 0002): git plumbing is
 * a workspace strategy, not core behavior, and now lives behind the
 * WorkspaceProvider seam in this package.
