 * parent is available) first so the LLM's KV cache can reuse the inherited
 * prefix across all subagent invocations.
 *
 * - "replace" mode: parent/genericBase + active_agent tag + env header +
 *   config.systemPrompt.  No `<sub_agent_context>` bridge and no
 *   `<agent_instructions>` wrapper — the custom prompt has full control and
 *   the final say.
 * - "append" mode: parent/genericBase + sub-agent context bridge +
 *   active_agent tag + env header + config.systemPrompt (wrapped in
 *   `<agent_instructions>` when non-empty).
 * - "append" with empty systemPrompt: pure parent clone.
 *
 * Both modes include an `<active_agent name="${config.name}"/>` tag so
 * downstream extensions (e.g. `@gotgenes/pi-permission-system`) can resolve
 * per-agent policy inside the child session by parsing the system prompt.
 * The tag follows the cacheable parent prefix in both modes.
 *
 * Only the parent prompt's identity is inherited — see `inheritedIdentity`.
 *
 * @param inherited  The parent agent's effective system prompt and the cwd it names.
