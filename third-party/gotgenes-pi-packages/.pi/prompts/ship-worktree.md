description: Root-session ship — ff-merge a rebased worktree branch into main, verify CI, close the issue, release, and tear down
---

# Ship a worktree branch (root session)

Argument: `$1` is the issue number whose peer branch is ready to land.

This is the **root-session** half of the parallel-worktree ship flow.
Run it after the peer session finished `/sync-worktree $1` (checks passed, retro committed, branch rebased onto local `main`).
It lands the branch on linear `main`, verifies CI, closes the issue, optionally releases, and tears down the worktree.

## 0. Confirm you are at the root, not in a worktree

Run `git branch --show-current`.
If it is not `main`, stop and report — you are in a peer worktree and want `/sync-worktree $1` instead.
Do this before anything else, so a mis-invocation costs nothing.

Then fetch the issue title via `gh issue view $1 --json title -q .title`, and call `set_session_name` with name `#$1 Ship (worktree) — <issue title>`.

## Release coordination (decide before step 1)

Gather the release decision up front, from the plan, **before** any irreversible work (ff-merge/push/CI).
A decision presented early is far less likely to be reversed than one inferred at the cancel point.

1. Locate the plan **on the peer branch** — it does not reach `main` until step 2, so the working tree does not have it yet:

   ```bash
   BRANCH=$(git branch --list "issue-$1-*" | tr -d ' +*')
   git grep -l "^issue: $1$" "$BRANCH" -- 'docs/plans/*' 'packages/*/docs/plans/*'
   ```

   The output is `<branch>:<plan-path>` — feed that line straight to `git show`.
2. If a plan is found, read its marker with `git show "<branch>:<plan-path>" | grep -F '**Release:**'` (fixed-string — a leading `*` is an invalid regex/BRE operator):
   - A marker containing `mid-batch — defer` → ask the operator **now**: defer the release (simply do not dispatch it for that package), or release anyway?
     Record the decision.
   - Any other `**Release:**` value, or no marker → record "release now"; do **not** ask.
   - No plan found on the branch → record "release now" and say so in the final report; do **not** let the absence pass silently.
3. Read the retro's `## Stage: Sync (worktree)` entry in full — the peer records release-relevant handoff there (a sibling package bumped by a docs-only commit, deferred work).
   It is a candidate source for step 6, not only for step 5's close targets.

This section only reads the plan and the retro, and (conditionally) asks — it performs no git, push, or CI action.
Step 6 applies the recorded decision.

## 1. Confirm root + sync main

1. Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `git branch --show-current` — confirm you are in the **root** checkout on `main`.
   If not, stop and report.
2. `git fetch origin`.
3. `git pull --ff-only`.
   If it fails for any reason, stop and report — do not stash, rebase, or force.
4. Check for unpushed root commits: `git rev-list --count origin/main..main`.
   `git pull --ff-only` reports `Already up to date.` when local `main` is merely *ahead*, so a non-zero count is invisible above (Refs #815).
   Report the count before step 2 — it explains a rejected ff-merge but does not predict one; step 2 does that.

## 2. Fast-forward merge the peer branch

The peer worktree shares this repo's `.git`, so the branch ref is visible locally — no fetch of the branch is needed.

1. Find the branch: `git branch --list "issue-$1-*"`.
   If zero or more than one match, stop and report.
2. Predict the merge before running it: `git merge-base --is-ancestor main <branch> && echo ff-ok`.
   If it fails, stop and send the peer back to `/sync-worktree $1` — do not push root commits to `origin` to make a stale rebase target agree (Refs #813).
3. `git merge --ff-only <branch>`.
4. If the merge is **not** a fast-forward, stop and report.
   Name the divergent commits with `git log --oneline <branch>..main` — run it without `wc -l`, and report those commits, not a cause inferred from `git log main`'s recent subjects (Refs #815).
   The peer must re-run `/sync-worktree $1`, rebasing onto the ref this merge will actually use, then retry this step.

## 3. Push

- `git push`.
- If rejected as non-fast-forward, stop and report — do not force-push.

## 4. Verify CI on the pushed commit

1. `git rev-parse HEAD` to capture the full 40-char SHA; pass that exact value to `ci_find` (workflow `ci`).
2. `ci_watch` with the returned `run_id` (workflow `ci`) and `timeout: 600`.
3. If the conclusion is `failure`, stop and report — do not close the issue, release, or tear down.
4. On `success`, continue.

## 5. Close the issue

Build the close comment from this issue's own commits, anchored on the plan commit — not on the package's last tag.
Each package releases on its own cadence, so a tag range spans every sibling issue that landed since (Refs #817).

```bash
PLAN=$(git log --format='%H' --grep="docs: plan .*(#$1)" -1)
git log --oneline "$PLAN"^..HEAD
```

If no plan commit matches, anchor on the parent of the issue's first commit.
From that range:

- "Implemented in <sha> …" — the commit carrying the behavior, not the range's last commit.
  Write **every** SHA the comment contains as plain text — no backticks — so GitHub auto-links each to its commit (Refs #733).
  Resolve every SHA with `git rev-parse` before drafting, then re-resolve every hex token in the finished draft — a hash typed mid-draft is where invention happens (Refs #777, #788).
- A short bullet list of feature/breaking commits.
- One sentence on user-visible behavior change.
- A note flagging any breaking change (`feat!:`).

Then call `issue_close` with issue number `$1` and that summary.
Also close any **other** issues this push shipped, with their own short summaries.
A co-shipped issue shows as a subject-trailing `(#M)` or a sibling `docs/retro/` file added in range — a body-line `Refs #M` is a citation, not a ship (Refs #793).

Then check the plan and the retro's stage notes for ship-time close targets — an adopted third-party PR is recorded there, never in the commit range.
Close each with `gh pr comment` then `gh pr close`, never merge, crediting the author by `@login` (Refs #670, #690).

## 6. Release (decoupled and serialized)

Releasing is the root's responsibility — peers never dispatch one.
The release workflow also carries a `release` concurrency group, so two runs cannot overlap even if one is dispatched by hand.

1. Apply the decision recorded in Release coordination.
   On "defer": **skip releasing** — simply do not name that package, note the deferral, and continue to teardown.
   Deferring holds only this package; siblings keep releasing on their own lands.
   Otherwise release now.
2. Derive candidate packages from the paths the range touched, not from commit types (re-derive `PLAN` — a fresh shell does not carry step 5's):

   ```bash
   PLAN=$(git log --format='%H' --grep="docs: plan .*(#$1)" -1)
   git diff --name-only "$PLAN"^..HEAD | sed -n 's#^packages/\([^/]*\)/.*#\1#p' | sort -u
   ```

   Do not filter by commit type: `docs:` and `chore:` are visible changelog groups that cut a patch on their own, so a `feat|fix` scope grep silently drops a sibling bumped by a docs-only commit (Refs #857).
   Step 3's `next-version.sh` is the authority on which candidates actually release.
   A cross-package plan bumps more than one — release every one (Refs #792).
3. Confirm each candidate with `./scripts/release/next-version.sh <pkg>`.
   It prints the tag that would be cut, or nothing when the package has no releasable commits.
   Never name a package that prints nothing: the run refuses it and nothing releases.
   A package the shipped range did **not** bump is a sibling and is not yours to release.
4. Dispatch once, naming every package to release:

   ```bash
   gh workflow run release.yml -f packages="<pkg> <pkg2>" -f sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
   ```

5. Follow it with `ci_find` (workflow `release`, that same SHA) and `ci_watch` with `timeout: 600`, then `git pull --ff-only`.
   If `prepare` fails, nothing was tagged and the release can be re-dispatched.
   If `publish` or `github-release` fails, the tags are already pushed — fix the cause and re-run those jobs rather than re-dispatching.

## 7. Tear down the worktree

Run `scripts/worktree-rm.sh $1 --delete-branch`.
The branch deletes cleanly because its commits are now in `main`; the worktree is not anyone's live CWD (the peer session can stay open or be closed — its work is landed).

## 8. Final report

Print:

- New HEAD on `main` (`git log --oneline -1`).
- Released version **per package** released, one line each (`git tag --points-at HEAD`), or that release was deferred and why.
  Name every package step 6's derivation listed — a listed package with no released version is a miss, not an omission from the report.
- Issue close confirmation(s).
- Worktree/branch teardown confirmation.
- Anything skipped and why.
- The next step: `/retro $1` — the deliberate, interactive final retrospective, run here at the root on `main` (commits straight to `main`).

Name `/retro $1` as the single next step.
Do **not** recommend the next issue to plan here — `/retro` surfaces the next roadmap issue at its end, after the retrospective is written.

## Constraints

- Never force-push.
- If the ff-merge is not a fast-forward, stop — the peer re-rebases; the root never merges non-linearly.
- If CI fails, the issue stays open and nothing is released or torn down.
- Never name a package in the release dispatch that `next-version.sh` reports nothing for — the run refuses it and no package releases.
- Never re-dispatch a release after `prepare` succeeded; the tags exist and the run would refuse on them.
- Peers never dispatch a release; only the root does.
