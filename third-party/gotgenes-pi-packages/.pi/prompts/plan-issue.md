# Plan a GitHub issue

Issue number: `$1`

Your job is to produce a numbered implementation plan for issue #$1, then commit it.
Single-package plans go in `packages/<PKG>/docs/plans/NNNN-<slug>.md`; cross-package plans go in `docs/plans/NNNN-<slug>.md`.
Stop after the commit.
Do **not** start implementation — the next step is `/tdd-plan` (for plans with test cycles) or `/build-plan` (for docs-only or non-code changes).

## Sync with remote (do this first)

Before reading anything, make sure the working tree is up to date with the remote so the plan is written against current `main`:

1. Run `git pull --ff-only`.
2. If it fails for **any** reason — uncommitted changes, divergent history, merge conflict, network error, detached HEAD — stop immediately and report the failure to the user.
   Do not attempt to stash, rebase, force, or otherwise resolve.
3. Only proceed once the pull reports a clean fast-forward (or `Already up to date.`).

## Load skills

Before investigating the issue, load skills relevant to the change:

- Load the `package-<PKG>` skill for each affected package (e.g., `package-pi-permission-system`) for package-specific architecture, priorities, and testing context.
- Load the `colgrep` skill before code exploration — it contains the decision table for when to use semantic search vs. exact grep, which shapes how you approach unfamiliar modules.
- Load the `code-design` skill for design principles and structural heuristics.
- Load the `testing` skill if the plan involves test changes or TDD steps, or if investigation will run a disposable spike test.
- Load the `markdown-conventions` skill — it contains project-specific rules (one-sentence-per-line, frontmatter schema) that differ from standard markdown conventions.
- Load the `design-review` skill and run its checklist before finalizing the design for any refactor, extraction, or change to shared interfaces or layer wiring — judge this from the issue, not from a plan that already shows wiring changes.
- Load the `tidy-first` skill if the change will create or modify `src/`/`test/` files — you will use it after the design is settled to dispatch the Tidy-First assessor, whose recommendations become preparatory steps in the plan's TDD Order (a docs-only or config-only change skips it).

## Gather context

1. Run `gh issue view $1 --json number,title,author,body,labels,state,comments` to read the issue body, labels, author, state, and discussion.
   `comments` must be a `--json` field — a separate `--comments` flag is silently ignored when `--json` is present.
   A closed issue, or one whose latest comment reports the fix is incomplete, changes the job: plan the residual as a new issue rather than re-planning the closed one (Refs #741).
   After fetching the issue, call `set_session_name` with name `#N Planning — <issue title>` to identify this session in the session selector.
   Then check the issue author against the gh CLI user: run `gh api user --jq .login` to get the authenticated user's login and compare it to the issue's `author.login`.
   If they match, the issue reflects the operator's own intent — treat the "Proposed change" as the working hypothesis (subject to the `Decide` gate below) and proceed normally.
   If they differ, the issue was filed by a third party (e.g., #389 was filed by `graelo`, an external contributor), so do not assume the proposed change is the direction the operator wants to take.
   A third-party issue is a request to evaluate, not a spec to implement — note this and surface the direction itself for the operator's confirmation in the `Decide` step before committing to a plan.
2. **Determine the target package(s).**
   Extract the `pkg:*` label(s) from the issue (e.g., `pkg:pi-permission-system` → package is `pi-permission-system`).
   If no `pkg:*` label exists or it seems incongruent with the issue content, ask the user which package this issue belongs to.
   If the issue has **multiple** `pkg:*` labels, the plan is cross-package — use `docs/plans/` at the repo root instead of a single package's directory.
   Labels are a hint, not the determinant: the plan is cross-package only if code in more than one package actually changes.
   If the confirmed scope is a single package despite multiple `pkg:*` labels, file in that package's directory.
   Set `PKG` to the package name for single-package issues; for cross-package issues, load skills for each affected package.
3. List the target plans directory (`packages/<PKG>/docs/plans/` for single-package, `docs/plans/` for cross-package) to see numbering and style conventions (create the directory if it does not exist yet).
   Pick the next free `NNNN` (prefer matching the issue number when reasonable).
   If `docs/plans/archive/` exists, those files use issue numbers from a previous repository — ignore them when resolving conflicts.
4. Read every issue the body references as a prerequisite or related (`gh issue view <n>`).
   Note whether each is implemented yet — your plan must say what it depends on vs. defers.
   Then search for open issues the body does **not** reference but that touch the same module or symbol (`gh issue list --state open --search "<symbol>"`) — a sibling issue on the same file changes the framing, and the operator should not have to supply it (Refs #635).
   Sweep open PRs the same way (`gh pr list --state open`) — a third-party PR on the same module often carries a diagnosis the issue omits, and it becomes a close target at ship time (Refs #670, #690).
   Read the newest backlog triage (`ls -1 docs/triage/*.md | tail -1`) for an entry on this issue — it bands the issue with siblings and records shared-cause hypotheses the body omits.
   A triage hypothesis is a lead to verify, not a finding (Refs #733: the "plausible shared cause" with #864 was disproved by two greps).
   When the diagnosis attributes the defect to an upstream dependency, search that tracker before treating the mechanism as settled (`gh issue list --repo <owner/repo> --state all --search "<mechanism>"`).
   Verifying the source and verifying the maintainer's posture are different claims (Refs #733).
5. Open the source files most relevant to the change and skim them before writing.
6. When a bug report does not reproduce locally, dispatch `Explore` (`model: "sonnet-5"`) for the root-cause hunt instead of running it inline — a hunt that ends in "not determinable from the code" still costs this session's context, and the plan is written right after (Refs #719).
   Verifying a diagnosis the report already supplies (named files, a numbered source trace) is not that hunt — keep it inline, since what it establishes is the design's input (Refs #709).
7. When the plan introduces a public API pattern (package `exports`, `Symbol.for()` accessor, service interface) or agent-facing message formatting (attribution tags, error prefixes, log labels), use colgrep or grep to search sibling packages for the established convention and follow it unless there is a documented reason to diverge.
   When a config key or public field names an SDK/domain concept (a tool-call part, event, or content type), use the SDK's own term for it — verify against the SDK types — rather than adopting a term from the issue body verbatim (Refs #580: `commandField` shipped, then needed renaming to `commandArgument` to match `ToolCall.arguments`).
   When the change introduces a mechanism a mature ecosystem already standardizes (log redaction, retry/backoff, caching, rate limiting), check what established libraries in that space actually do before building the `ask_user` option set — a set built only from first principles can omit the standard, lowest-maintenance choice (Refs #647).
   When the plan **removes** an existing repo-wide convention rather than introducing one, find why it was introduced before planning its removal: `git log -S'<literal>'` to the first commit, then read that commit's plan and retro.
   A rationale that turns out to govern a *different* mechanism belongs in the plan's Non-Goals, or the convention gets restored later on the strength of the same memory (Refs #778: the `promptSnippet` name prefix had no recorded rationale; the remembered one was `promptGuidelines` attribution).
8. Determine the issue's **release recommendation** from the package's architecture roadmap, if it is part of one.
   Grep `packages/<PKG>/docs/architecture/architecture.md` for the step that references this issue (`(#$1)` / `[#$1]`) and read its `Release:` tag (defined by the `improvement-discovery` skill):
   - `Release: independent` (or no tag, or the issue is not in any roadmap) → **ship independently**.
   - `Release: batch "<name>"` → look up `<name>` in the roadmap's `Release batches` subsection; if this step is the batch tail (last listed member) → **ship now — batch tail**; otherwise → **mid-batch — defer**.
   You will write this into the plan's `Release Recommendation` section (see Write the plan).

## Check for prior session context

Before starting fresh, check whether prior sessions have already done work on this issue:

1. Search for an existing retro file: look for `packages/*/docs/retro/NNNN-*.md` and `docs/retro/NNNN-*.md` where NNNN matches the issue number (zero-padded to 4 digits).
2. If a retro file exists, read it in full.
   It contains stage-boundary notes from prior sessions — summaries, observations, friction points, and decisions already made.
3. If prior stage entries exist (e.g., a "Stage: Planning" entry from an earlier attempt), factor them into your approach.
   Do not repeat work that was already completed unless explicitly asked.
4. If no retro file exists, this is the first session on this issue — proceed normally.
5. If this issue is a release-batch **tail** (its roadmap step is the last member of a `Release: batch "<name>"`), also read the retros of the earlier batch members for work they explicitly deferred to the tail (e.g. a doc refresh deferred from a predecessor).
   Fold any such deferred work into this plan's `Module-Level Changes`.
   Refs #441.

## Decide

Treat the issue's "Proposed change" as a hypothesis, not a spec.
An extraction that only relocates statements to lower a complexity metric — introducing no new collaborator and moving no behavior onto data — is procedure-splitting, not design improvement.
When the issue prescribes a specific decomposition, verify (against the `code-design` heuristics) that each extracted piece returns a value, owns state, or gives behavior to data before planning around it.
When the issue proposes a new aggregate, report, or roll-up for human/agent consumption (not a refactor), grep the concrete downstream reader (a retro lens, a README section, a prompt) before designing its shape — a proposal can satisfy every code-design heuristic and still have no consumer (Refs #546).

Classify whether the change is breaking — independently of whether it is ambiguous.
A change is breaking if it alters the observable behavior, output shape, or default of existing code or config on upgrade without a user edit.
A bug fix that changes a default value is breaking, even when the old behavior was wrong.
If breaking, state it in Goals and use `feat!:`/`fix!:` with a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer.
When the change alters a documented contract (an event's timing guarantee, a default, an output shape), state the classification in the gate's substance message even when an ADR already settled it.
A settled call and an unasked one look identical to the operator (Refs #787).

Classify whether the change contradicts the package's published scope.
Grep `packages/<PKG>/README.md` and `docs/architecture/architecture.md` for Non-Goals and scope-table rows that name the mechanism you are about to change, and read the close comments of any issue or PR they cite.
A collision found after the design settles can only be argued around; found before the first gate it is one of the gate's options (Refs #858).

Before writing the plan, identify any genuinely ambiguous design choices.
If there are 1–2 such choices (breaking-vs-non-breaking, result-shape change, fallback semantics, etc.), use the `ask-user` skill once to surface them with a short context summary and concrete options.
Skip this step if the issue's "Proposed change" section is unambiguous.

If the issue is third-party (its author is not the gh CLI user, as determined in Gather context), do **not** skip the `ask-user` gate even when the proposed change is unambiguous.
The ambiguity for a third-party issue is not *how* to build it but *whether* the operator wants it built, and in what form.
Use `ask-user` to confirm the direction before planning: at minimum ask whether to (a) implement the proposal as described, (b) implement a different approach to the same underlying problem, or (c) decline/defer.
When the issue is in an unfamiliar domain (a platform, protocol, or tool you have not verified), research the domain facts first — the direction options themselves depend on them, and an ungrounded ask gets bounced (Refs #533).
When an option's differentiator is a behavior change, name the scenarios where behavior differs and where it does not (see `AGENTS.md` § Clarification gates).
Label every number in an `ask_user` option or the plan's predicted-effect table as measured or estimated.
Measure when the command runs in under a minute; an inferred number with false precision ("18.0 s → ~18.5 s") sells an option on a benefit the real measurement may refute (Refs #678).
A qualitative cost claim ("only reformats", "nothing is lost") is measurable too — produce the output and diff it before offering the option (Refs #865).
When the proposal also has design ambiguities, fold those into the same `ask-user` call.
Let the operator's answers — not the issue body — drive the plan's Goals and Design Overview.

If the issue is a decision-record or ADR issue (its deliverable is a decision, not code), do **not** skip the `ask-user` gate even when a design is already written down.
The deliberation is the deliverable: existing architecture-doc prose is an input to put to the operator, not a settled spec to transcribe.
Surface the open parameters (and any the prose treats as closed but the issue's own motivation reopens) for the operator's confirmation before planning (Refs #581).

## Tidy First assessment

With the design settled and the target files known — but before writing the plan — follow the `tidy-first` skill: dispatch the `tidy-first-assessor` subagent over the `src/`/`test/` files the change will touch, then fold its **Recommended** preparatory refactorings into the plan's TDD Order as `refactor:`/`test:` steps ahead of the work each prepares.
Make the change easy, then make the easy change.
The assessment runs in a subagent so the many-files read does not consume this session's context.
Skip when the change touches no `src/`/`test/` files (the skill's applicability gate) and note the skip.

The assessor reads the real files against your design summary, so treat a contradiction it reports — a function that does not exist, an interface with a different shape, a call-site count that is off — as a correction to the design before the plan records it.

## Write the plan

File: `packages/<PKG>/docs/plans/NNNN-<short-slug>.md` (single-package) or `docs/plans/NNNN-<short-slug>.md` (cross-package).

Start with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
issue: $1
issue_title: "<exact title from `gh issue view`>"
---
```

Then an H1 title (e.g., `# <short descriptive title>`) — required by markdownlint MD041 — followed by the body sections:

- **Release Recommendation** — the first `##` section after the H1, so it is prominent.
  Write the canonical grep-able marker line (`/ship-issue` reads it) as exactly one of:
  - `**Release:** ship independently`
  - `**Release:** ship now — batch "<name>" tail (this issue completes the batch)`
  - `**Release:** mid-batch — defer (batch "<name>"); confirm at ship time`

  Use the value derived in Gather context step 8, then add a sentence of rationale (which batch, why independent).
- **Problem Statement** — quote the issue's framing in your own words.
- **Goals** — bullet list, scoped to this change.
- **Non-Goals** — explicitly defer anything tangential (sibling issues, follow-ups).
- **Background** — relevant existing modules/functions and how they relate.
  Flag any constraint from AGENTS.md that applies.
- **Design Overview** — decision model, data shapes, separation of concerns, edge cases.
  Include code-fenced TS types when shape changes.
  When the design introduces a new collaborator that multiple consumers will use, sketch the consumer's call site (3–5 lines of pseudocode) to verify the interaction pattern follows Tell-Don't-Ask and Law of Demeter.
  When the design extracts code into a new module, sketch the extracted module's interaction with its upstream dependencies (3–5 lines) to verify it doesn't carry Tell-Don't-Ask violations, output-argument mutations, or reverse-search patterns from the original code.
  Fix upstream API gaps in the plan before planning the extraction.
  When a new exported function accepts domain objects, verify the parameter type follows ISP — list which fields the function reads and confirm the type doesn't carry unused fields.
  When the plan consolidates code from multiple methods into a shared helper, verify the methods have the same lifecycle semantics — different guards, cleanup scopes, or shutdown-vs-normal-operation contexts indicate structural duplication that should not be extracted.
  When the design has N sibling call sites each supply the same derived fact, check whether a shared downstream point already stamps per-call fields (a runner, a writer, a factory) — a fact every sibling merely relays belongs there, not in N places (Refs #746).
  When the issue proposes moving or relocating a class to a new owner, list every method's callers and what fields/state each method touches.
  If most methods operate on the target owner's fields, the class may be an intermediary that should be dissolved into the owner rather than relocated intact.
- **Module-Level Changes** — file-by-file list of what's added, changed, or removed.
  When a step removes or renames an export, grep all `src/` and `test/` files — plus `.pi/skills/package-*/SKILL.md` and `packages/<PKG>/docs/architecture/` (which name internal symbols in narrative prose, not only tree listings) — for every removed symbol before finalizing the file list (Refs #476).
  When the removed export is a public or cross-extension API surface (a `package.json` `exports` re-export, an event channel, a `Symbol.for()` accessor), also grep the whole `packages/<PKG>/docs/` tree — user guides and top-level docs reference a public mechanism by name, not just `docs/architecture/` (Refs #531).
  When a step reworks the documented behavior of a mechanism rather than removing a symbol (e.g. a patch description, an architecture note, or wording like "prepends" → "includes"), also grep `.pi/skills/package-*/SKILL.md` for the mechanism name — reworded prose carries no removed symbol to match.
  When a step renames a heading, anchor, or named concept another doc may cite as an example (not just a package symbol), widen the skill grep to the whole `.pi/skills/` tree — a shared skill (`improvement-discovery`, `code-design`) can name a package doc's section by heading, and `package-*` alone misses it (Refs #601).
  When a step resequences or reworks a documented workflow or step-order, grep the edited file itself (not only sibling docs) for other passages describing the same sequence — a prompt or skill often states its workflow twice (a narrative list plus an Output-format section), and editing one leaves the other stale (Refs #534).
  When a step removes a call to a private (non-exported) function, grep the file for other callers — if the removed call was the sole call site, list the function for removal in the same step.
  When the change adds, removes, or moves a module, check `packages/<PKG>/docs/architecture/` for layout listings, complexity tables, health metrics, or domain diagrams that reference the affected files and list them as doc updates.
  When the issue is a numbered roadmap step, list the architecture-doc `✅` step-mark (heading + Mermaid node) and its `Landed:` note as an expected doc update — `/tdd-plan` lands it at implementation completion; do not defer it to phase-history-write time or declare it out of scope (Refs #540).
  When a step moves a module to a different directory, grep same-directory `./<module>` importers too — not only `#src/<module>` alias imports; a `./`-relative import to a module leaving the directory carries no `#src/` marker to match, so an alias-only grep silently drops it (Refs #559).
  When the change adds, removes, or renames a slash command or user-facing feature, grep `packages/<PKG>/README.md` for the command/feature name and list the stale sections as doc updates — a README documents commands, not module filenames, so the `src/`-symbol grep misses it (Refs #470).
  When a step corrects a literal value that appears in prose (a path, default, or identifier in sample output, log snippets, or ADR code comments), grep the whole `packages/<PKG>/docs/` tree for the old value — not a hand-picked file subset; stale sample logs and decision-record comments do not surface in a `src/`/`test/` grep.
  When a step changes a character or codepoint, grep the `\uXXXX` escaped form as well as the literal — or scan non-ASCII wholesale (`rg -n '[^\x00-\x7f]'`); a codebase often spells the same glyph both ways, sometimes in one file.
  When a file appears in Module-Level Changes, verify it is not also claimed as unchanged in Non-Goals — contradictions between these sections cause confusion during implementation.
  When a plan step's verify criterion names a specific static-analysis finding as resolved (a clone fingerprint, a dead-code symbol, a complexity target), the step's design or Module-Level Changes must show which change clears it — do not list a finding as expected-gone without a change mapped to it.
  When the roadmap supplies a metric's recompute command (a `grep`/`fallow` invocation in the health-metrics table), run it at planning time to establish the real baseline and predict the post-change value — do not infer the target number from prose.
  A coarse grep also counts sites the plan's Non-Goals deliberately keep (presentation dispatch, single-status guards), so reconcile the predicted number against those exclusions rather than claiming a lower one (Refs #563).
  When a step adds a field to a serialized contract (a request/response persisted to disk or sent over the wire) whose reader reconstructs only an allowlist of known fields (a tolerant `asX`-style parser), list that reader as a touch point — an added field is silently dropped on read otherwise, and the gap surfaces only in a cross-consumer round-trip test, not `tsc` (Refs #558).
  When a step tightens a shared helper's parameter type (e.g. `unknown` → a concrete type with required fields), grep `test/` fixtures as well as `src/` callers and list them as touch points — a partial literal that satisfied the loose type fails the tightened type at compile time, and a `src/`-only call-site grep misses the test fixtures (Refs #539).
  When a step tightens an **optional** interface field to required (drops `| undefined`), grep the exact `<field>: undefined` literal across all `test/` files — an incidental fixture sets the field to `undefined` without ever reading it, so a grep for the field's *use* sites under-catches (Refs #611).
  When a step adds a **new required** field to a shared interface, grep for constructors of that type — inline object literals and `test/helpers/` factories — not its use sites.
  The field never existed, so the grep above has no `<field>: undefined` literal to match; a shared test fixture is the common miss (Refs #744).
- **Test Impact Analysis** — for extraction and refactoring issues: (1) what new unit tests does the extraction enable that were previously impossible or impractical?
  (2) what existing tests become redundant with the new lower-level tests, and can they be simplified or removed?
  (3) which existing tests must stay as-is because they genuinely exercise the layer being extracted?
  For a prompt or skill change, the shell commands the new text prescribes are its testable surface: dry-run each at planning time and record the expected output, so `/build-plan` can re-run them as verification (Refs #767).
  When the plan introduces a parser or matcher, its testable surface is the input domain rather than the inputs you can picture.
  Run the candidate over every real sample available, and include this repo's own authoring conventions among the shapes it must survive — `markdown-conventions`' four-backtick fence is the case this missed (Refs #818).
- **Invariants at risk** — when the change touches a surface a prior phase step already refactored, list that step's documented invariants (the architecture roadmap's `Outcome:`/`Landed:` bullets) and name the test that pins each — add a test if the invariant lives only in prose.
  Open each test you name — a file that mocks the layer under test pins nothing about it (Refs #806).
  A later step must not regress an earlier step's outcome with a green suite.
  When an invariant is quantitative (a byte-identical prefix, a token budget, a cache or latency characteristic), measure the baseline and predict the post-change value at planning time.
  A prose argument that the change is "at the tail" or "negligible" is not evidence, and a test pinning adjacent content does not pin the number (Refs #640).
  When the plan removes the mechanism an existing test's comment credits, spike the removal and run that test at planning time — that the test stays green is a measurement, not an argument (Refs #653).
- **TDD Order** — numbered red→green→verify→commit cycles.
  Each item names the test surface, what's covered, and the suggested commit message (`test:`, `feat:`, `feat!:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).
  A suggested `feat:`/`fix:` subject names the observable outcome, not the seam it edits — it ships to the changelog verbatim (Refs #724).
  Each item that adds tests also names its **killing mutation**: the one-line change to the code under test that must turn the step's new tests red.
  Write it as an edit a reader could apply ("make `resolveBackgroundMode` return `request.isBackground` unconditionally"), not as a description of intent.
  This is where a test's discriminating power is cheapest to specify — stating it forces you to name the signal that distinguishes the step's two outcomes, which is the check that catches an assertion passing under both (Refs #724).
  When a step's tests span several equivalence classes, name one mutation per class and say which tests each should kill; a mutation that leaves a test green is a finding only when the plan predicted otherwise.
  When a step **moves** an existing registration or call site rather than adding one, name a mutation that deletes it at the new site — a relocated line is as unpinned there as at its old one (Refs #827).
  The Tidy-First assessment's accepted preparatory refactorings are steps here like any other, each with its `refactor:`/`test:` commit message and a sentence naming the friction it prepares.
  Place each one before the step it prepares — leading the whole order when every later step depends on it, immediately before the relevant part when a larger plan needs its tidying split across several points.
  The implementing session executes them in order; it runs no second assessment.
  When a change has a mechanism half and a data half — a walker plus its lookup table, a parser plus its keyword list — sequence them as separate steps.
  They have different failure rates and different verification instruments, and fusing them makes every data defect re-review the mechanism.
  When the data is a table of external facts, write the check that verifies one row before writing the rows (Refs #823).
  When the plan introduces a new mutable field, specify its whole lifecycle — set, cleared, read — in one step's description rather than one transition per step.
  Two steps that each name a different transition read correctly alone and can still contradict each other, which only execution reveals (Refs #465).
  When a refactor replaces a type, interface, or function that a large test file depends on, use lift-and-shift: introduce the new thing alongside the old, migrate callers and fixtures incrementally across steps, then remove the old in a final step.
  Never plan a single step that requires rewriting an entire large test file at once.
  When a step removes a factory or export that has a single call site (e.g., `index.ts`), include the call-site update in the same step — the type checker will not allow them in separate commits.
  When a step removes an export (not just renames it), every importing module and its tests break at the type level in that commit — fold the extraction, all consumer updates, and all consumer-test updates into one step regardless of call-site count.
  When a step removes fields from an interface and a downstream file constructs an object literal satisfying that interface, include the call-site update in the same step — TypeScript's excess property checking rejects the stale fields immediately.
- **Risks and Mitigations** — concrete risks and how the plan addresses each.
  When a risk asserts what happens if a mechanism is **absent**, spike its removal — a spike that exercises the mechanism present verifies the happy path, not the risk.
  Dropping `.catchall(...)` was predicted to fail closed; zod silently strips instead (Refs #808).
- **Open Questions** — defer-until-needed items.

If the change is breaking, say so explicitly in Goals and use `feat!:` in the suggested commit messages.

## File follow-up issues

If planning identified work to defer to a separate issue (a follow-up named in Design Overview, Non-Goals, or Open Questions), create it now with `gh issue create` — before the plan commit, while this session holds full context.
Record each new issue number in the plan's Non-Goals / Open Questions.
File nothing speculative — only follow-ups the plan concretely names.

After filing, load the `roadmap-fit` skill and follow it for each new issue — an issue spun off while its package has an open improvement phase gets a recorded disposition now, not at phase close.
The skill exits at its first step when no phase is open.

## Commit

Lint the plan file first so a markdown slip is caught here, not at the next stage's baseline (a `[#N]` mention inside backticks is a code span, not a reference, so its `[#N]:` definition trips `MD053`):

```bash
pnpm exec rumdl check <plan-file>
```

Fix any findings, then commit:

```bash
git add <plan-file>
git commit -m "docs: plan <short summary> (#$1)"
```

## Write stage notes

Before stopping, persist planning observations for cross-session continuity:

1. Determine the retro file path: same location logic as the plan file (single-package → `packages/<PKG>/docs/retro/NNNN-<slug>.md`; cross-package → `docs/retro/NNNN-<slug>.md`).
   Use the same slug as the plan file.
   Create the directory if needed.
2. If the retro file does not exist, create it with YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   issue: N
   issue_title: "<exact title from issue>"
   ---
   ```

   Followed by `# Retro: #N — <issue title>`.
3. Append a stage entry:

   ```markdown
   ## Stage: Planning (<ISO 8601 timestamp>)

   ### Session summary

   2–3 sentences on what was accomplished in this planning session.

   ### Observations

   Note any significant decisions made, alternatives considered and rejected, risks identified, or scope adjustments.
   Keep it concise — this is a breadcrumb trail for future sessions, not a full retrospective.
   ```

   When the Tidy-First assessor rejected candidates as scope creep, add a `#### Deferred tidyings` subsection under `### Observations`, one line per item naming the file and the friction — `/plan-improvements` greps this exact heading across retro files to triage them in a later improvement round (Refs #787).
   When the operator decides during this session that an improvement phase should open before this issue's implementation, record the candidate cause and the sequencing call under a `#### Phase handoff` subsection there too — `/plan-improvements` greps this exact heading in its Step 1, and a handoff recorded under an ad-hoc heading surfaces only by luck (Refs #724).
4. Commit: `git add <retro-file> && git commit -m "docs(retro): add planning stage notes for issue #N"`.

Wrap code identifiers, filenames, and text containing underscores in backticks in the retro file.
Append with the `Edit` tool (or `Write` for a new file), not a shell heredoc.
When appending a new stage to an existing retro, anchor the `Edit` on the file's last line or use `Write` with the full content — the repeated `### Observations` / `### Session summary` headers make header-anchored edits ambiguous.

Then print a 5-line summary of the plan's key decisions and stop.
