description: Execute the TDD steps from a package docs/plans/ plan as red→green→verify→commit cycles

# Execute a plan with TDD

Argument: `$1` is either a plan path, an issue number, or empty (use the most recently modified plan).

## Sync with remote (do this first)

Before locating or reading the plan, make sure the working tree is up to date with the remote:

1. Determine the branch: `git branch --show-current`.
2. **Worktree branch** (an `issue-*` branch): run `git fetch origin` and proceed.
   A diverged `origin/main` (a sibling peer landed first) is expected here — do **not** `git pull --ff-only` and stop; the worktree ship flow (`/sync-worktree`) owns rebasing onto `origin/main`.
3. **Trunk** (`main`): run `git pull --ff-only`.
   If it fails for **any** reason — uncommitted changes, divergent history, merge conflict, network error, detached HEAD — stop immediately and report the failure to the user.
   Do not attempt to stash, rebase, force, or otherwise resolve.
   Only proceed once the pull reports a clean fast-forward (or `Already up to date.`).

## Locate the plan

- If `$1` looks like a path, use it.
- If `$1` is a number, find `packages/*/docs/plans/NNNN-*.md` or `docs/plans/NNNN-*.md` matching that integer (issue number or plan number).
- Otherwise, use the newest file across all `packages/*/docs/plans/` and `docs/plans/` (by mtime).

If the plan lives under `packages/<PKG>/docs/plans/`, that determines the target package.
If the plan lives under `docs/plans/`, it is cross-package — load skills for each affected package listed in the plan.

Read the plan in full before doing anything else.
If "TDD Order" is missing or empty, stop and report — re-run `/plan-issue` first.

Extract the issue number from the plan filename (pattern `NNNN-`) or from the plan's frontmatter `issue:` field.
If the issue title is not in the frontmatter, fetch it via `gh issue view N --json title -q .title`.
Call `set_session_name` with name `#N TDD — <issue title>` to identify this session in the session selector.

## Load prior session context

Check whether prior sessions have already done work on this issue:

1. Extract the issue number from the plan filename (pattern `NNNN-`) or its frontmatter `issue:` field.
2. Search for an existing retro file: look for `packages/*/docs/retro/NNNN-*.md` and `docs/retro/NNNN-*.md` matching the issue number.
3. If a retro file exists, read it.
   Prior stage entries contain summaries and observations from earlier sessions (e.g., planning decisions, risks identified, alternatives rejected).
4. Use this context to inform your work — it may contain warnings about edge cases, decisions that were already debated, or friction points to avoid repeating.

## Load skills

Before executing the TDD cycle, load skills relevant to the change:

- Load the `package-<PKG>` skill (e.g., `package-pi-permission-system`) for package-specific architecture, priorities, and testing context.
- Load the `code-design` skill for design principles, TypeScript conventions, and structural heuristics.
- Load the `testing` skill for Vitest mock patterns and TDD planning rules.
- Load the `pre-completion` skill — you will use it after the final TDD step to dispatch the quality reviewer.

## Verify green baseline

Before writing any code, confirm the starting state is clean:

1. `pnpm run check` — must pass.
2. `pnpm run lint` **from the repo root** — must pass.
   Package-scoped lint (`pnpm --filter …`) silently passes on `MD051` cross-file fragment links and cross-package issues that CI's root lint catches.
3. `pnpm run test` — must pass.
4. `pnpm fallow dead-code` **from the repo root** — must pass.
   CI gates it on every `main` push, so a finding at the end is only actionable if you know whether the baseline was clean (Refs #714).

If a check fails on an issue your change will not touch (e.g. a pre-existing lint warning in an unrelated doc), fix it as a separate cleanup commit (`docs:`, `style:`, or `fix:` as appropriate) to establish a green baseline, then proceed.
If the failure is non-trivial, or you cannot quickly establish why it is failing, stop and report to the user.
Do not start TDD cycles from a broken baseline.

## Execute the TDD cycle

The plan's Tidy-First preparatory steps (`refactor:`/`test:` steps naming the friction they prepare) are ordinary steps here.
Execute them in place, each as its own commit leaving the tree green, and run no separate assessment — `/plan-issue` already dispatched the assessor.
If the tree has moved since the plan was written and a preparatory step no longer fits what it describes, stop and report rather than improvising a substitute.

For **each** step in the plan's "TDD Order", in order:

1. **Red.**
   Write the failing tests the step describes.
   Run only the affected test file: `pnpm --filter @gotgenes/<pkg> exec vitest run <test-path>` and confirm failures (plain `pnpm vitest run` fails at the repo root in this workspace).
   When the step pins a literal pattern (regex, glob, format string), derive your own input set — the plan's examples are a floor, not the case list.
   Run the pattern over the values the repo already produces in bulk (`git tag --list`, `gh pr list`) before committing (Refs #817).
   When the step quotes a string the code under test **produces** (a rendered sentence, an error message), copy it from the producer or an existing assertion — a plan transcribes it from memory and drops an article (Refs #772, #844).
2. **Green.**
   Implement the minimum code to make those tests pass.
   Re-run the same file and confirm green.
   When the step adds or changes a shared type/interface (or a loop/consumer over one), run `pnpm run check` before committing — Vitest does not typecheck, and a type error caught only at end-of-cycle forces a commit reorder.
3. **Verify the pins.**
   Apply the killing mutation the plan named for this step, confirm the step's new tests go red, then revert it.
   Fixing a vacuous test costs nothing here and costs an amended commit later, which is why this sits before the commit rather than in the end-of-cycle review.
   These cases make this mandatory rather than optional, because the Red step's own evidence does not cover them:
   - The step's red came from a **signature change** (a required field that did not exist yet), so every test failed for the same reason and none of them demonstrated that its own assertion discriminates.
   - A test was **authored or rewritten after Green**, so it never had a Red step at all.
   - The step's tests span more than one equivalence class — one mutation kills one class, so a surviving test is only evidence when you can say which mutation should have killed it.
   - A new test **stayed green during Red**, so Red produced no evidence it discriminates — a deliberate regression pin and a vacuous probe look identical (Refs #801).
   - The step **relocated** an existing call or registration, so the plan's mutations cover the code it authored and not the line that merely changed sites (Refs #827).

   Save the green file first (`cp <file> /tmp/green.ts`) and restore from that copy; `git checkout -- <file>` reverts to HEAD, discarding the step's own uncommitted green edit (Refs #830).
   Re-run before committing; never commit with a mutation in the tree.
   Apply the mutation with `Edit`, and confirm the file changed before reading the suite — a scripted multi-line substitution that matches nothing reads exactly like a mutation that killed nothing.
   Count the reds against the step's prediction: a mutation that kills fewer tests than the plan named is a finding, not a pass — either the test was never written or the plan's claim was wrong (Refs #844).
4. **Commit.**
   Use the commit message the plan suggests, or a Conventional Commits message that matches:
   - `test:` for test-only commits (rare; usually folded into the feat).
   - `feat:` for new behavior.
   - `feat!:` for breaking changes the plan calls out (include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer).
   - `fix:` for bug fixes.

One logical change per commit.
Do not bundle multiple TDD steps into one commit.

When a step replaces a type or function that many tests depend on, use lift-and-shift: add the new alongside the old, migrate test fixtures incrementally, then remove the old.
Do not rewrite an entire large test file in one shot.

If a step uncovers a problem the plan didn't anticipate (e.g. a downstream test breaks), fix it as part of the same commit and note the deviation in the commit body.
If the deviation is large, stop and ask.
If a plan's quantitative target (LOC, clone count, complexity) does not fall out as the plan predicted, treat that as a deviation: re-decide via `ask_user` rather than escalating the abstraction to force the number.

## Filing an issue mid-implementation

When a step surfaces work outside the plan's scope, file it and keep going — do not scope-creep the step.
Then load the `roadmap-fit` skill and follow it: an issue spun off while its package has an open improvement phase gets a recorded disposition at filing time, not at phase close, which is too late to fold anything in.
The skill exits at its first step when no phase is open, and recording a disposition never authorizes implementing the work now.

## After the last TDD step

1. Run the full suite: `pnpm run test`.
   Must be all green.
2. Run the type check: `pnpm run check` (`tsc --noEmit`).
   Must succeed — Vitest does not typecheck.
3. Run the linter **from the repo root**: `pnpm run lint`.
   If it fails, run `pnpm exec biome check --write .` to auto-fix, then re-check.
   Fix all failures — including pre-existing ones unrelated to the current change.
   Commit any fixup as part of the most recent feat commit (amend) only if you haven't pushed; otherwise as a `style:` commit.
   The fixup must NOT land in a `docs:` commit.
4. Run the fallow dead-code gate **from the repo root**: `pnpm fallow dead-code`.
   Running from a package subdirectory detects fewer entry points than CI, producing false positives that become stale suppressions in CI.
   If it exits non-zero, load the `fallow` skill and fix the findings — prefer declaring a real contract (`implements`) or removing dead exports over suppressing; suppress only verified false positives.
   Commit fixes as part of the most recent feat commit (amend) if not yet pushed; otherwise as a `fix:` commit.
   If the plan names a quantitative target (a complexity/CRAP score, a clone count, a refactoring-target drop-off), load the `fallow` skill to find the right verification subcommand — confirm a file left the targets list with `fallow health --targets --format json` (an empty `targets` array), not by grepping the human-readable output (Refs #537).
5. Check for unstaged lockfile changes: `git diff --name-only pnpm-lock.yaml pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
   `pnpm install` can touch `pnpm-workspace.yaml` too (a `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` entry when a dependency is bumped to a freshly-published version).
   If modified, stage and commit it as part of the most recent feat commit (amend if not yet pushed) or as a separate `fix:` commit.
6. Cross-check the plan's "Module-Level Changes" table against actually-changed files.
   If a listed file was not touched, update it now or note the deviation.
7. If `packages/<PKG>/docs/architecture/` exists, check whether the changes affect the module structure or data-flow descriptions and update them.
   If the issue completes a numbered roadmap step, prefix `✅` on both the step heading and its Mermaid diagram node — a `Landed:` detail line is not a substitute for the `✅`.
   Flip the phase status row only when every step in the phase is done.
8. Commit doc updates as `docs: <summary>`.
9. Preview the changelog: `git log --format='%s' <plan-commit>..HEAD | grep -E '^(feat|fix)'`.
   Every surviving line must name a user-observable outcome, not an internal seam.
   A seam-named line is either a mistyped commit (retype to `refactor:`) or a correct `fix:`/`feat:` with a mechanism-named subject (reword to the symptom).
   Fix either now, while nothing is pushed (Refs #724).
10. **Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`** — the release workflow owns it and will generate entries from your Conventional Commit messages on the next release.

## Pre-completion review

Load the `pre-completion` skill and follow the dispatch protocol.
Proceed to "Summarize" only after the reviewer returns PASS or WARN.

## Summarize

Print:

- `git log --oneline <N>` for the commits you just made (N = number of TDD steps + docs).
- One-line summary of behavioral change.
- Any test-count delta.
- Any deviations from the plan.
- Pre-completion reviewer verdict (PASS / WARN / FAIL with one-line summary).

## Write stage notes

Before stopping, persist implementation observations for cross-session continuity:

1. Determine the retro file path: same location as the plan file (single-package → `packages/<PKG>/docs/retro/`; cross-package → `docs/retro/`).
   Use the same `NNNN-<slug>` as the plan file.
   Create the directory if needed.
2. If the retro file does not exist, create it with YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   issue: N
   issue_title: "<exact title from issue>"
   ---
   ```

   Followed by `# Retro: #N — <issue title>`.
3. Append a stage entry:

   ```markdown
   ## Stage: Implementation — TDD (<ISO 8601 timestamp>)

   ### Session summary

   2–3 sentences: what was implemented, how many TDD cycles completed, test count delta.

   ### Observations

   Note deviations from the plan, unexpected edge cases, tests that were harder than expected, and any decisions made during implementation.
   Include the pre-completion reviewer's verdict (PASS / WARN / FAIL) and any WARN findings.
   If the session was cut short (not all TDD steps completed), note which steps remain.
   ```

4. Commit: `git add <retro-file> && git commit -m "docs(retro): add TDD stage notes for issue #N"`.

Wrap code identifiers, filenames, and text containing underscores in backticks in the retro file.
Append with the `Edit` tool (or `Write` for a new file), not a shell heredoc.
When appending a new stage to an existing retro, anchor the `Edit` on the file's last line or use `Write` with the full content — the repeated `### Observations` / `### Session summary` headers make header-anchored edits ambiguous.

Stop.
The next step is `/ship-issue` on trunk, or `/sync-worktree <N>` (peer session) on an `issue-<N>-*` branch.
