# Retro: #251 — Return transcript-formatted output from read_session and read_parent_session

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-27T18:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Produced a 4-step TDD plan to replace raw JSON output from `read_session` and `read_parent_session` with a structured transcript format.
The plan extracts a shared `formatTranscript` module in `src/format-transcript.ts` that handles tool result folding by `toolCallId`, sequential numbering of conversation turns, and metadata entry formatting.

### Observations

- The `ParsedEntry` type from `parent-session.ts` and the `SessionEntry` type from the SDK both use `{ type: string; [key: string]: unknown }` structurally, so the formatter can accept a minimal `TranscriptEntry` interface without importing SDK types.
- The `@gotgenes/opencode-session-context` plugin provides a proven reference format, but Pi's session model differs significantly (separate `toolResult` message entries vs. inline `parts`, `AgentMessage` union with `bashExecution` and `custom` roles, tree-structured entries).
  The formatter must handle these Pi-specific shapes rather than directly porting the OpenCode implementation.
- The existing tests assert `JSON.parse(text)` on tool output — step 4 rewrites these assertions to check transcript text, which is a non-trivial test update but keeps the step atomic since the formatter is already tested in isolation by that point.
- No ambiguous design choices needed user input — the issue's "Proposed behavior" section was comprehensive and unambiguous.

## Stage: Implementation — TDD (2026-05-27T22:30:00Z)

### Session summary

Implemented all four TDD steps: basic message formatting, tool call summaries with result folding, metadata entry formatting, and wiring both tools.
Test count grew from 15 to 47 (+32).
All checks pass: `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test`, `pnpm fallow dead-code`.

### Observations

- **`TranscriptEntry` index-signature conflict** — Planning assumed `{ type: string; [key: string]: unknown }` would work for both SDK `SessionEntry[]` and test fixtures.
  In practice, TypeScript refuses to assign `SessionEntry[]` (no index signature) to `TranscriptEntry[]` (with index signature).
  The fix was to drop the index signature from `TranscriptEntry`, making it `{ type: string }`, and use `as unknown as Record<string, unknown>` internally where non-`type` fields are needed.
  This removed double-casts at consumer call sites (the SDK call in `index.ts` is now cast-free).
- **Test excess-property checking** — With `TranscriptEntry = { type: string }`, inline object literals passed directly to `formatTranscript([{ type: "compaction", tokensBefore: 48000 }])` fail excess-property checking.
  The fix was to assign entries to `const entries = [...]` variables first — excess-property checking does not apply to variables, only direct literals.
- **Biome/ESLint lint friction** — Three lint issues surfaced during implementation: `noNonNullAssertion` on `as TranscriptEntry[]`, `noUnnecessaryCondition` on a `!== undefined` guard, and `useTemplate` on a string concatenation in tests.
  All resolved without introducing ESLint-disable comments.
- **Pre-completion reviewer verdict** — PASS with two non-blocking WARNs: (1) `README.md` omits `read_session`/`read_parent_session` (pre-existing gap); (2) `formatTranscript` appears at the bottom of its module rather than the top, and `extractToolArgHint`'s default branch uses a single-iteration `for`/`break` loop.

## Stage: Final Retrospective (2026-05-28T02:45:00Z)

### Session summary

Issue #251 shipped across three sessions (planning, TDD implementation, shipping) plus this retro.
The implementation added a shared `formatTranscript` module to `@gotgenes/pi-session-tools`, replacing raw JSON output from `read_session` and `read_parent_session` with a structured transcript format.
Released as `pi-session-tools-v1.0.0` (major bump due to breaking output format change).

### Observations

#### What went well

- **Model routing** — Planning ran on `claude-opus-4-6`, TDD on `claude-sonnet-4-6`, shipping on `deepseek-v4-flash`, retro on `claude-opus-4-6`.
  The shipping phase (mechanical: pull, lint, push, CI, close, merge) completed cleanly on the most cost-efficient model with zero friction.
- **Pre-completion reviewer catch** — The reviewer flagged the `README.md` documentation gap for `read_session`/`read_parent_session`, leading to the `docs: document read_session and read_parent_session transcript format in README (#251)` commit before shipping.
- **User doc audit prompt** — The user's question “We updated our docs, and skills, correct?”
  triggered a thorough audit of all markdown references to the changed tools, confirming only `README.md` and `.pi/prompts/retro.md` (line 90, unchanged usage hint) referenced them.

#### What caused friction (agent side)

1. `missing-context` — The planning session loaded the `code-design` skill but designed `TranscriptEntry` with `{ type: string; [key: string]: unknown }`, directly contradicting the skill’s rule at line 136: *“prefer a minimal structural supertype like `{ type: string }` over an index-signature type.”*
   Impact: ~8 Edit/check tool calls across 4 `pnpm run check` cycles during TDD step 4 to resolve cascading type errors (single cast rejected, double cast needed internally, test inline literals needed variable extraction).
   Self-identified during TDD — the agent discovered the conflict when `pnpm run check` failed, not during design.
2. `instruction-violation` — The TDD session used `\u2192` escape sequences in Edit tool `oldText` instead of the literal `→` character.
   The system instructions explicitly state: *“include them literally in `oldText` — exactly as they appear in the file.”*
   Impact: one failed Edit call, one user correction (“Use unicode literals in `oldText`, per system instructions”).
   User-caught.

#### What caused friction (user side)

- No friction points identified.
  The user’s interventions (Unicode correction, doc audit prompt) were well-timed and concise.

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — The pre-completion reviewer subagent ran on default model (appropriate for judgment work).
  The `deepseek-v4-flash` model handled the `/ship-issue` phase cleanly — good match for its mechanical, protocol-following nature.
- **Escalation-delay tracking** — The `TranscriptEntry` index-signature conflict consumed ~8 consecutive tool calls on the same type error before resolution.
  The agent tried progressively more invasive fixes (single cast → double cast → drop index signature → internal casts → test variable extraction) rather than stepping back to re-read the code-design skill.
  In hindsight, re-reading the skill after the first `pnpm run check` failure would have pointed directly to the `{ type: string }` solution.

### Changes made

1. Appended final retrospective stage entry to `packages/pi-session-tools/docs/retro/0251-transcript-formatted-output.md`.
