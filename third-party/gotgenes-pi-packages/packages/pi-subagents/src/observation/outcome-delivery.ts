/**
 * outcome-delivery.ts — Shared rendering for a subagent outcome.

 * A terminated child's outcome reaches the parent model through exactly one
 * carrier: the foreground tool return, the resume tool return, the
 * `get_subagent_result` report, or the completion nudge. Each carrier owns its
 * own framing (spawn notes, XML envelope, report header) and its own
 * truncation — a nudge is a preview, a pull is the full text — but the body
 * they wrap is the same fact, so it is rendered here rather than four times.
 *
 * Pure functions only: no SDK types, no record types, no side effects.

 * the nudge reported an abort as "max turns exceeded" while the foreground
 * result added "output may be incomplete", and the pull and resume carriers
 * reported nothing at all. Presentation still differs — see the two renderers
 * below — because a standalone label and a mid-sentence parenthetical are
