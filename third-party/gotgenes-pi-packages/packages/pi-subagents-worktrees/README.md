Git worktree isolation for [`@gotgenes/pi-subagents`](https://github.com/gotgenes/pi-packages/tree/main/packages/pi-subagents).

This extension registers a `WorkspaceProvider` with the subagents core: opted-in agents run in a temporary git worktree (an isolated copy of the repo), and any changes they make are saved to a branch when they finish.
Worktrees are one _workspace strategy_, not core behavior — so the git plumbing lives here, outside the minimal subagents core (see [ADR-0002] in the pi-subagents package).

## Install

Install **after** `@gotgenes/pi-subagents`.
Pi loads packages in the order they are listed in `.pi/settings.json`, and this extension registers its provider with the subagents service at load time — so the subagents core must load first.

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:@gotgenes/pi-subagents",
    "npm:@gotgenes/pi-subagents-worktrees"
  ]
}
```

If `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` is not loaded first (or not installed at all), this extension does nothing.

## Configuration

Worktree isolation is **opt-in per agent type**.
List the agent types that should run in a worktree in a `subagents-worktrees.json` file:

- Global: `~/.pi/agent/subagents-worktrees.json`
- Project: `<cwd>/.pi/subagents-worktrees.json` (overrides global)

```json
{
  "worktreeAgents": ["general-purpose", "refactorer"]
}
```

An agent type not in `worktreeAgents` runs in the parent working directory, exactly as if this extension were not installed.

## Behavior

- A child whose agent type is listed gets a fresh detached worktree at `HEAD` before it runs.
- When the child ends its turn with a question for you, the worktree is kept so the child can be resumed into it; cleanup happens when the resumed child finishes instead.
  A question you never answer keeps the worktree until the subagents core releases the child's session.
- When the child finishes with no changes, the worktree is removed.
- When the child finishes with changes, they are committed to a branch (`pi-agent-<id>`), and the child's result gains a note: `Changes saved to branch \`<branch>\`. Merge with: \`git merge <branch>\``.
- If a commit hook rejects that commit, it is retried once with `--no-verify`, because the commit exists to rescue work the child already did and a rejecting hook would otherwise cost you that work.
  Files a hook rewrote before failing are re-staged, so a formatter's corrections are committed rather than discarded.
  The note then gains a second line reading `Commit hooks were bypassed to save this work — review the commit before merging.`
- If cleanup fails for any other reason, the worktree is **left in place** rather than removed, and the child's result gains a note: `Worktree cleanup failed; the worktree was left in place at \`<path>\` for manual recovery: <error>`.
  Nothing is deleted while its state is uncertain, so the work stays recoverable.
- If worktree creation fails for an opted-in agent (not a git repo, no commits yet, or `git worktree add` fails), the child run **fails** with an explanatory error rather than silently running unisolated.
- At the start of every session with a UI, any rescue worktrees still on disk are named in a warning, so a preserved worktree is not forgotten once the child's result scrolls out of view.

## Recovering preserved worktrees

A preserved worktree is a plain git worktree with the agent's work still in it.
Inspect it with `git -C <path> status`, and recover the work however you normally would — commit it on a branch, or copy the files out.

Run `/subagents-worktrees` at any time to list the preserved worktrees for the current repository.
Selecting one offers to remove it, and removal happens only after you confirm — nothing here is ever deleted automatically, because a failed cleanup is exactly the case where the content is not safe to discard on the extension's judgment.

A worktree is listed when it is registered with the repository, named with this package's `pi-agent-` prefix, still on disk, and not currently in use by a child of this session.
A worktree belonging to a **different** Pi process running against the same repository cannot be told apart from an abandoned one, so it is listed too — check the path before removing anything.

## Migrating from `isolation: "worktree"`

Earlier versions of `@gotgenes/pi-subagents` accepted an `isolation: "worktree"` spawn flag.
That flag was removed from the core; install this package and list the agent types you want isolated in `worktreeAgents` instead.

## Scope and non-goals

**Purpose.**
The subagents core asks a `WorkspaceProvider` where each child session should run.
This package is one answer: opted-in agents get a temporary git worktree, and whatever they produce is rescued to a branch when they finish.

**In scope.**
The git plumbing bracketing a child run, not losing the child's work when cleanup fails, and making a preserved worktree discoverable and removable.

**Non-goals.**

- _Workspaces for anything but subagent child sessions._
  Worktrees for parallel human-driven Pi sessions are a different mechanism, with different lifetimes and naming, and are not served from here.
- _Anything after the rescue branch._
  Merging it, opening a PR from it, or cleaning up old `pi-agent-*` branches is your workflow.
- _Deleting a preserved worktree automatically._
  A failed cleanup is exactly the case where the content is not safe to discard on the extension's judgment.
- _Handing removal to the agent._
  Recovery is a slash command rather than a tool, keeping a destructive `git worktree remove --force` out of the model's reach.
- _Worktree knowledge in the subagents core._ `git` does not appear there; uninstalling this package leaves children running in the parent's directory.

**Where adjacent requests belong.**
