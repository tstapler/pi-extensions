## Monorepo Structure

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo.
Each package under `packages/` is a Pi extension published to npm under `@gotgenes/`.
Always launch Pi from the repo root — the root `.pi/settings.json` and `.pi/prompts/` are only discovered from CWD.
The working directory is always the repo root, so for a package-scoped script run `pnpm --filter @gotgenes/<pkg> run <script>` (or `pnpm -C packages/<pkg> run <script>`) from the root instead of `cd packages/<pkg> && pnpm run <script>`.
Before working on a specific package, load its `package-<name>` skill for architecture, priorities, and testing context.
Load skills inline — never dispatch a subagent to load skills.
When adding a new package, wire it into all of:

1. `.pi/settings.json` — add the `../packages/<pkg>` load path.
   Add the `{ "source": "npm:@gotgenes/<pkg>", "extensions": [], "skills": [] }` disable entry (prevents double-load) **only after the package's first npm publish** — before that, the `npm:` reference makes Pi and the subagent launcher `npm install` a nonexistent package and fail (Refs #600).
2. `README.md` — add the package to the Packages table, and to the no-dedicated-skill note unless it ships a `package-<pkg>` skill.
3. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` — add the package to the `Package` dropdown in **both** forms.
   The dropdown is `required: true` and `blank_issues_enabled: false`, so a package missing here cannot be reported at all.
   These are static YAML that GitHub reads from the default branch, so they cannot derive the list at run time the way the labeler does (Refs #818).
4. `gh label create pkg:<pkg> --description "Issues related to <pkg>" --color 0075ca` — the label must exist before an issue selects the package, or `scripts/label-issues.sh` fails on `gh issue edit`.

Release configuration is **not** on that list, and neither is the issue auto-labeler.
Both derive the package list from the workspace on disk: `scripts/release/lib.sh` and `scripts/issue-package-labels.sh` enumerate `packages/*/package.json`, so a new package is picked up with no edit at all (Refs #818, #865).
Repo-level work — build, CI, tooling, cross-package docs — is labeled `scope:repo` rather than with every package's label.
That scope is always asserted (the forms' repo-wide option, or `gh issue create --label scope:repo`), never inferred from the absence of a package.

A multi-line `run:` block in `.github/workflows/` belongs in `scripts/`, with the workflow keeping a one-line invocation.
Split a script that pushes from the read-only derivation it calls, and refuse the pushing half outside CI — `scripts/release/prepare-release.sh` guards on `CI`, `scripts/release/next-version.sh` only prints (Refs #816, #865).

### Releasing

Releases are **dispatched, never automatic**.
`.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers only on `workflow_dispatch` and takes an explicit package list plus an optional expected-SHA guard:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f packages="pi-subagents pi-colgrep" -f sha="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

Naming packages explicitly is the point: several can be releasable at once, and only the named ones go.
Deferring a release is therefore an omission with no state to clean up — just do not name the package.
A `release` concurrency group serializes runs.

To see what would release, without releasing anything:

```bash
./scripts/release/next-version.sh <pkg>   # prints <pkg>-v<version>, or nothing
./scripts/release/verify-cliff-parity.sh  # all packages: tags, package.json, and what is pending
```

Both are read-only and offline.
Never name a package that `next-version.sh` prints nothing for — `prepare-release.sh` validates every named package **before** writing anything, so one such package refuses the whole run and nothing is tagged.

The run's three jobs are `prepare` → `publish` → `github-release`.
If `prepare` fails, nothing was tagged and the release can simply be re-dispatched.
If a later job fails, the tags are already pushed — fix the cause and re-run that job; re-dispatching would refuse on the existing tag.

Versions and changelogs come from [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org) reading local git, with no network in the derivation.
See `docs/decisions/0002-git-cliff-release-automation.md` for why, and for the accepted residual (there is no release-PR review gate).

A brand-new package's **first** release is a manual, operator-chosen step. npm Trusted Publishing cannot create a package that does not exist, so `publish` 404s; and `next-version.sh` refuses an untagged package rather than inventing a first version, because this repo's packages opened at 1.0.0, 0.2.0, and 0.1.0 with no convention to infer.
Publish the first version manually (`pnpm login`, then `pnpm --filter @gotgenes/<pkg> publish --access public --no-git-checks` — no `--provenance`), tag it `<pkg>-v<version>`, then configure the Trusted Publisher on npmjs.org (repo `gotgenes/pi-packages`, workflow **`release.yml`**).
The publish needs an interactive terminal when the registry requires an OTP (`ERR_PNPM_OTP_NON_INTERACTIVE`) — the operator runs it, not the agent (Refs #732).
Every release after that runs through the workflow (Refs #600, #865).

A cross-package change bumping a dependent package to a **same-day-published** sibling hits pnpm's 24h `minimumReleaseAge` supply-chain gate — CI's `--frozen-lockfile` install and local `pnpm exec` hooks fail `ERR_PNPM_MINIMUM_RELEASE_AGE_VIOLATION`.
`minimumReleaseAgeExclude` does not fix it (honored at resolution, ignored by pnpm's lockfile verification pass); the repo sets `trustLockfile: true` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` to trust the reviewed lockfile and skip that re-verification.
Do not remove it, and do not reach for `minimumReleaseAge: 0` (which also disables the delay for a fresh `pnpm add`).
Refs #626.

A package's internal docs directories — `docs/plans`, `docs/retro`, `docs/architecture`, `docs/decisions`, `docs/assets` — are excluded from its release scope by convention, in `scripts/release/lib.sh`.
Adding one of those subdirectories needs no configuration edit; adding a differently named one does.
Commits that only touch excluded paths do not trigger releases, and neither do files outside the package tree.
A package's own `CHANGELOG.md` is excluded too, so a release commit never re-enters the next changelog.

### Docs-in-distribution convention

The published npm tarball ships runtime code, user-facing docs, and nothing else — no dev files (`test/`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `AGENTS.md`, `.pi/`, `.prettierignore`) and no internal working docs.
Every package uses a `files` allowlist in `package.json`; no package uses `.npmignore` (Refs #484, #523).
A bare directory entry (e.g. `"src"`) is recursive, so runtime code ships without allowlist edits as it grows; npm always auto-includes `package.json`, `README*`, and `LICENSE*` regardless of the allowlist.
List only the additional top-level ship targets explicitly: `dist` (built type bundles), `schemas`, `config/*.example.json`, and user-doc paths.
Ship the docs the README links to (`docs/*.md` plus referenced subdirectories such as `guides`/`migration`/`assets`/`architecture`/`decisions`), never a bare `"docs"` entry — that would also ship `docs/plans` and `docs/retro`.
A package with no user-facing docs omits any `docs` entry from its allowlist entirely.
A link from a shipped doc into a non-shipped path (`docs/decisions/`, `docs/architecture/`) resolves to nothing in the tarball — use an absolute GitHub URL, or add the target to `files` (Refs #647).
Verify the allowlist with `pnpm --filter <pkg> exec pnpm pack --pack-destination /tmp` and inspect `tar tzf` for the expected file set — confirm it contains runtime code and user docs, and excludes `test/`, dev config, and internal docs.
Run `pnpm fallow dead-code` locally before pushing a new or dependency-changed package — CI gates on it, and `devDependencies` copied from a sibling package often include unused entries.

### Architecture-doc conventions

Every package's `docs/architecture/architecture.md` module-tree entries describe **current behavior** — what each module is now.
Cite an issue in a module-tree entry **only** when the ref encodes an active constraint (a lint-guarded boundary, an ADR string boundary, a structural invariant); all other provenance belongs in git log and `docs/architecture/history/`, never in the tree (the "relocated #559, dissolved #505, renamed #510…" trail).
Without this discipline, the per-change doc-update commits that append provenance re-inflate the tree — the debt #601 and #605 paid down in bulk for pi-permission-system and pi-subagents.
`/finish-phase`'s bounded doc-hygiene step holds each phase's touched module-tree entries to this standard (Refs #601, #605, #606, #607).

An accepted residual — an ADR bullet, a follow-up issue body — is a claim about the **mechanism**, not the symptom that exposed it.
Enumerate the mechanism's inputs before writing it.
The residual recorded for #821 was rewritten three times because each draft generalized from its last probe.

### Reading this repo's own artifacts

When mining history for a **durable** claim — a scope charter, a triage verdict, an ADR, a README boundary — this repo's artifacts answer narrower questions than they appear to.

A plan's `## Non-Goals` is scoped to that change, not to the package.
It answers "what is out of scope for this change", never "what is out of scope forever", and it mixes three unrelated claims under one heading: sequencing (not in this change), deferral (not until someone asks), and a real boundary (not ever, and here is why).
So **a plan Non-Goal is a lead, not a citation** — use it to find the ADR or numbered design principle, and cite that.
A Non-Goal decays fastest in the most active packages: `pi-colgrep`'s plan `0092` declared `promptGuidelines` out of scope and `fa164a19` changed one the same day under the same issue, and `pi-github-tools`' plan `0005` forbade retry/timeout on one-shot tools before #673 and #764 added both (Refs #775).

The same holds for a plan's enumerated **external** facts — a command's options, an API surface, a spec's values.
Verify each against the real surface (`man`, `--help`, the schema) before it lands in a security boundary; #807's plan omitted `find -fprint0` and admitted `file` as read-only, and both shipped as fail-opens.
Documentation answers whether a flag exists, not what a given binary does with it — run the tool when the answer gates a security boundary.
A shared table row asserts its fact of every implementation the *name* reaches: `grep --context` takes no separate argument and `rg --context` does, and `awk` is GNU awk on Fedora and one-true-awk elsewhere (Refs #823).
A dependency floor is a claim about **each** symbol the change uses, not about the release that introduced the feature.
`git tag --contains <sha>` answers which release carries one commit; sibling accessors can land in a later one.
Resolve every symbol against the candidate floor (`git show <tag>:<path> | grep <symbol>`) before pinning it (Refs #812).

Pull-request status is an **inverted** signal here, because the repo reimplements adopted third-party changes through its own TDD cycle rather than merging them.
Seven of nine closed-unmerged external PRs on `pi-permission-system`, and six on `pi-subagents`, shipped as capability with `Co-authored-by` credit — so "closed unmerged" usually means *accepted*.
Read the close comment, never the close status.
An **open** PR is not a decline either: #692 sits unmerged because the policy-source channel is undecided (#639), while `pi-permission-system` design principle 8 anticipates the capability outright.

Check an ADR's frontmatter `status:` before citing it.
`pi-subagents` `docs/decisions/0001-deferred-patches.md` is `superseded`, and it is still the only record of the `pi -e` ephemeral-extension limitation.

A roadmap step's `Outcome:` line is written from the symptom at phase-planning time, before anyone traced the mechanism, so it can promise relief the change does not produce for the example it names.
Trace that example through the code before turning an `Outcome:` into a test.
Phase 14 Step 10 promised `cat /outside/a.ts > /outside/b.ts` would narrow, but both tokens derive the same `/outside/*` glob, so a test written from the line would have passed under the old code (Refs #810).

### Workflow

- Keep scope tight.
- Prefer small, reversible changes.
- Preserve intentional behavior unless there is a clear reason to change it.
- Ask before removing functionality or changing defaults.
- To check a GitHub issue/PR's state (including upstream repos), use `gh issue view N --repo owner/repo`, not web search.
- Never run a state-mutating command (`gh issue close`, `gh pr merge`, `git push`) to discover what it does — it executes.
  Probe with a read-only query (`gh api .../issues/N --jq .state`) or `--help` (Refs #661).
  When such a command fails with a transient error (HTTP 5xx), verify whether it applied before retrying — `gh pr merge` can 503 after the merge lands.
  Probe with REST (`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/N --jq .merged`), which stays up when the GraphQL endpoint behind `gh pr view --json` and `gh pr merge` is degraded (Refs #732).
  This applies to any hand-run `gh pr merge` (Refs #764).
- For Pi SDK internals (prompt assembly, caching, session lifecycle), read Pi's own source at the `pi` checkout beside this repo's main checkout, rather than the installed `dist/` bundles or their sourcemaps.
  That is `../pi` from the root checkout and `../../pi` from a worktree — the worktree sits one level deeper, so the bare `../pi` misses it (Refs #801).
  Dispatch an `Explore` subagent with `model: "sonnet-5"` for a multi-hop trace there (e.g. "how does `ui.custom` pass keybindings to the factory?") — a targeted read of a known file is fine inline, but a hunt costs 5–10 greps of this session's context, and `Explore`'s haiku default is too weak for the reasoning.
  Keep the trace inline when its output is a universal claim the design will rest on — a subagent returns it as a summary you would have to re-verify anyway (Refs #801).
  The checkout tracks Pi's `main` and runs ahead of the pinned dependency.
  Read it for mechanism, but confirm any API you design around exists in the installed version first — resolve the version from the package's own `devDependencies` pin, then `grep` the types under that exact `node_modules/.pnpm/@earendil-works+pi-coding-agent@<version>_*/` directory (Refs #661).
  The bare `@*/` glob matches every version in the store, and `head -1` can select one below the package's declared peer floor (Refs #858).
  Existence is not enough for a seam you design *around*: a callback's position in the call order, and the data populated by the time it fires, are visible only in the compiled `.js`, never in the `.d.ts` (Refs #696).
  A line number read there is not citable at all: the checkout drifts mid-session (Refs #733).
  Cite the pinned version from the installed package's sourcemap — `dist/*.js.map`, `sourcesContent`.

#### Tool-injected messages

The `pi-autoformat` extension emits a `[pi-autoformat] Formatted N file(s)` message after `Edit`/`Write`.
It is informational — not a turn boundary.
Continue the current step (e.g. Red→Green→Verify→Commit) until it is complete.
It also reflows what you just wrote (line wrapping, quote style), so an `oldText` — or a shell/regex pattern — built from the layout you emitted can fail to match; re-read a region you just edited before matching against it again.
It also joins a line ending in `:` with the sentence after it — to add a sentence there, start a new paragraph, not a new line.
It likewise joins a sentence onto the previous line when the sentence opens with a lowercase token (a package or command name such as `git-cliff`) — lead with a capital instead (Refs #816).
It fires on `Edit`/`Write` only, so a file appended with a shell heredoc skips formatting entirely and fails `pnpm run lint` — append source with `Write`/`Edit` too, not just markdown.

#### Stale prompt-template expansion

A slash command's expanded body is a snapshot from when the Pi process loaded it — so after this session edits a `.pi/prompts/*.md` template, a later same-process invocation of that command can run the **pre-edit** copy.
When the pasted prompt body contradicts the on-disk file (e.g. you just changed `/ship-issue` and its steps read stale), treat the **on-disk file as authoritative** and follow it, not the injected text (Refs #586).

#### Stale in-process extension code

Pi loads each package's extension once at session start, so a session that edits `packages/<pkg>/src/` keeps running the **pre-edit** tool for the rest of its life.
When the change targets a tool the workflow itself calls (`ci_find`, `ci_watch`, `issue_close`), restart Pi before the step that uses it — otherwise `/ship-issue` exercises the old behavior and the new code looks broken (Refs #673).
The same applies when a change **removes** a tool `/ship-issue` calls: the running session still has it registered (Refs #865).

The same staleness makes the session's own system prompt a reliable witness for the **published** behavior: a defect in prompt assembly (a tool's `Available tools:` line, a guideline bullet, an injected block) is readable in context at zero tool cost.
Read it before hunting the SDK — but never to verify your own fix, which the running session cannot see (Refs #778).

#### Edit tool batches

A multi-edit `Edit` call is atomic: if one `oldText` fails to match, the whole batch is rejected and nothing is applied.
Each `edits[]` entry has exactly one `oldText`/`newText` — put a second replacement in a second array entry, never as `oldText2`/`newText2`.
Extra suffixed keys are silently ignored while the tool still reports `Successfully replaced N block(s)`, so count reported blocks against intended edits (Refs #605).
After a rejection, re-apply every intended edit (not just the ones you retried) and run `pnpm run check` to confirm none were silently dropped — but `tsc` passes on a dropped `import type` removal (an unused type import is not an error), so re-read the affected region rather than trusting the check alone.
When an edit's `oldText` would span a decorative comment rule (a long run of `─`/`═`) or a width-padded table row, anchor on adjacent unique code lines rather than the padded span itself — miscounting it fails the whole atomic batch, and `rumdl fmt` does not re-pad tables for you.
When the rule line is itself the target (deleting a section header with its block), copy it from a fresh `Read` of that region — retyping the dash run is what fails the batch.
When the rule line must be **rewritten** (a new label, so the padding changes), `Edit` has nothing to copy — write the line programmatically (`'─' * (78 - len(label))`).
If you delete such a block by line number with `sed`, re-read the region afterward to confirm you did not remove an enclosing brace.
A multi-line `perl -0777`/`sed` regex substitution across many similar blocks is a trap — a non-greedy `.*?` group spans block boundaries and silently corrupts a neighbor; collapse repeated multi-line literals with per-block `Edit` calls and reserve scripted substitution for single-line per-symbol renames (Refs #525).
A scripted bulk edit across test files cannot tell a mock **producer** from an **assertion**, whatever its regex safety, so its correctness rests on the suite rather than the script.
That holds only where assertions are exact (`toEqual`/`toHaveBeenCalledWith`).
A touched `toMatchObject`/`objectContaining` site absorbs a wrong insertion and still passes — re-read those by hand instead of counting the green run as verification (Refs #726).
Run the full package suite, not the files the rename's own grep matched — a mock *producer* spells the symbol as an object key (`externalPaths:`), which a call-site grep (`\.externalPaths\(`) never sees (Refs #807).
A replacement containing backslashes is a trap even as a single-line rename — shell, perl, and the regex engine each consume an escape level.
Use `Edit` (Refs #653).
A scripted symbol rename also rewrites the prose *around* the symbol, where the old signature's adjectives survive as contradictions ("the zero-arg `getRootPermissionsService()`").
Grep the words that described the old shape (`zero-arg`, `takes no`, the old arity) after the script — no gate flags them (Refs #794).
When wrapping existing lines in a new enclosing block (a `describe`, function, or `try`), emit the opening and closing braces as two `edits[]` entries in one `Edit` call (or use `Write`) — a lone opening brace fails the whole file parse, and the close is too far from the open to anchor in the same `oldText`.
Inserting a new *sibling* block (a second `describe`, a new function) mid-file can close the enclosing block early and reparent everything after the seam.
`tsc`, lint, and a green suite all miss it, so anchor the insertion on the enclosing block's own closing line and verify with `grep -n '^describe\|^});'` (Refs #788).

#### Multi-session issue lifecycle

Larger issues span multiple sessions, each handling one stage.
The standard flow is:

1. `/plan-issue #N` — read the issue, explore the codebase, produce a numbered plan, commit it.
   For a code-touching change, a fresh-context `tidy-first-assessor` runs after the design is settled and before the plan is written; its accepted preparatory refactorings become `refactor:`/`test:` steps in the plan's TDD Order (Kent Beck's Tidy First).
2. `/tdd-plan` or `/build-plan` — execute the plan (TDD for code changes, build for docs/config).
   The preparatory steps are ordinary plan steps here; a fresh-context `pre-completion-reviewer` runs the quality gate at the **end**.
3. Pre-completion review — dispatched automatically at the end of step 2; a fresh-context `pre-completion-reviewer` subagent runs deterministic checks and a judgment checklist before recommending `/ship-issue`.
4. `/ship-issue #N` — push, verify CI, close the issue, dispatch the release.
5. `/retro` — review the session(s) for workflow improvements, persist retro notes.

A change that lands outside `/tdd-plan` or `/build-plan` fires no automatic `pre-completion-reviewer` dispatch.
Dispatch one by hand before committing a rewrite of an artifact a prior review rejected (Refs #639).

Each prompt template writes a stage entry to `docs/retro/NNNN-<slug>.md` (or `packages/<PKG>/docs/retro/`) before finishing.
These entries accumulate across sessions and serve as the cross-session context bridge — when a later stage starts, it reads the retro file to pick up decisions, observations, and warnings from prior sessions.

An issue spun off mid-lifecycle — by a step's implementation, a plan's follow-up, or a retrospective — is evaluated for roadmap fit when it is filed, not at phase close, so load the `roadmap-fit` skill at the filing point.
It exits immediately when the package has no open improvement phase; otherwise it records the operator's disposition (fold into a step / new step / defer / out of scope) in the roadmap's `#### Open-issue sweep dispositions` list, and filing-without-scope-creeping remains the correct local move.
`/finish-phase` reconciles the phase window's issues against that list before archiving, so a miss surfaces at phase close instead of vanishing from the history (Refs #767).

Release batching is plan-driven: `/plan-improvements` annotates each roadmap step with a grep-able `Release:` tag (and a `Release batches` subsection), `/plan-issue` derives a `Release Recommendation` from those annotations, and `/ship-issue` and `/ship-worktree` read the plan's `**Release:**` marker early — asking only when it is `mid-batch — defer`, otherwise releasing now.
A `refactor:`/`style:`/`test:`/`build:`/`ci:` commit is a skipped changelog type and does not cut a release on its own; such work lands on `main` and auto-batches into the next releasing commit.
`chore:` is **not** skipped — it is a visible "Miscellaneous Chores" section and cuts a patch on its own, as it did under release-please.
So a refactor-only plan's `Release Recommendation` rationale must not claim it will cut a release (Refs #479).
Do not reason about this from commit types when you can ask: `./scripts/release/next-version.sh <pkg>` applies the real rules offline and prints the tag that would be cut, or nothing.

Release is independent of any issue's open/closed state: holding an issue open does not defer its merged `fix:`/`feat:` commits, and closing one does not release them (Refs #625).
The only lever is which packages a release dispatch names, which makes deferral per-package by construction and leaves no state behind — there is no open pull request to remember.
A cross-package change names every package it bumps in one dispatch (Refs #792).

Before #865 this was release-please's job, and much of the machinery above existed to work around its API commit walk: a `last-release-sha` baseline, two scripts maintaining it, and a per-component release PR to merge.
All of it is gone.
When reading history — a retro, an older plan, a commit message — treat `last-release-sha`, `separate-pull-requests`, `release_pr_merge`, and `defaultMergeMethod` as artifacts of that era, not as current mechanism.

#### Clarification gates

Present the substance — concrete examples, before/after, trade-offs — in a message first, then call `ask_user` with options that reference it.
An option list is a set of choices, not a briefing; context crammed into option descriptions — or into `preview` panes — gets bounced (Refs #635, #737, #746).
When the decision settles a structure that will repeat across many files, settle its **size budget** in the same gate.
A placement or shape choice is only sound for a known size, so show a worked example of the largest instance (Refs #775).
Define a gate's terms of art before its substance — a term the operator must decode is a question they cannot answer (Refs #786: `node`, chain `link`, and the service accessor each bounced a gate).
When rejecting a candidate on cost, price its cheapest viable form — #786 dismissed a session-keyed accessor as a semver-major redesign, and its additive variant became the adopted decision.
When every option shares a premise — the same object grown, the same representation assumed, the same vocabulary kept — name it and offer the option that removes it, or say why it is not viable.
Refs #787: three wiring options all grew `AgentPrepHandler`, and the operator's "too many responsibilities" note produced the extraction that made the new dependency unnecessary.
Refs #639: three gates on `commandEffects` all assumed pattern-keyed matching, and the operator's "done with pattern-based expressions" produced the structured shape that dissolved the overlap, merge, and guard questions at once.
When a gate offers mechanisms for fixing a hazard, first name which component or config rule owns the lever and what happens today in each concrete configuration — a mechanism menu without that grounding gets bounced for it (Refs #789, #803).
In a bundled gate the substance requirement is per question, not per message — the least-supported question bounces the whole batch (Refs #866).

#### Background agent guardrails

When delegating lint-fix or refactoring work to a background agent:

- Do not change function semantics (removing comparisons, altering control flow, removing defensive checks).
- Only add `eslint-disable` comments or make type-safe transformations (removing unused imports, adding type annotations).
- Include `pnpm -r run test` as a verification step before reporting completion.

A read-only agent needs a scope bound too — `find /` is read-only and still walks every mounted volume, trips the external-directory permission gate, and can read a stale copy of a dependency.
Bound its searches to the repo, and require fixing a failed pattern before widening its root (Refs #696).

A subagent's universal claim ("no ordering issue", "nothing else calls this") is the one to verify — a positive finding ships the line that proves it, a universal one quantifies over cases the report never shows.
Check a multi-question report against itself first: #725's trace answered "the `tools` option is an allowlist" and "there is no capping issue" in the same document, and answered the second by citing a test fixture rather than the implementation (Refs #725).

The mirror holds for a claim **you** supply: a reviewer cannot verify a coverage assertion handed to it as a premise, so state what you checked, not what you conclude was covered.
When a change creates N artifacts that cross-reference each other, enumerate the edges rather than sampling them (Refs #775).
The same holds for a measurement: hand a reviewer the raw source and a mandate to re-derive, not your tables.
A measurement is also scoped to the commit it was taken at: re-run it after any behavior change rather than defending it, and never re-use a cached baseline whose result depends on filesystem state (Refs #823).
A `pre-completion-reviewer` given ADR 0013's own numbers returned PASS; an adversarial reviewer given the log returned four blocking defects (Refs #639).

##### Parallel peer sessions (git worktrees)

Run two agents in parallel by giving each its own git worktree and its own interactive Pi session.
Use `/worktree <issue>` (the project-local `.pi/extensions/worktree.ts` command) or `scripts/worktree-new.sh <issue> [initial-command]` directly.
The launcher creates branch `issue-<N>-<slug>` off `origin/main`, checks out a worktree at `~/development/pi/pi-packages-worktrees/issue-<N>`, runs `pnpm install`, and spawns a new WezTerm tab whose CWD is the worktree, launching `pi --approve "/plan-issue <N>"`.

Key properties:

- CWD is set at spawn (`wezterm cli spawn --cwd`), never via `cd` — the peer session is born in its worktree, so the `pi-permission-system` `external_directory` gate never fires for its own work.
- `--approve` is required: Pi keys project trust by directory path, so each fresh worktree is untrusted and would otherwise block on a startup trust prompt.
- The launcher also runs `mise trust` on the worktree: `mise` gates trust by config-file path too, so a fresh worktree's `mise.toml` `[env]` block (the `scripts/bin` `npm -> pnpm` PATH shims) is skipped until trusted — trusting before `pnpm install` keeps the shims on PATH for both the install and the peer session.
- The initial slash command is passed as Pi's first positional message, which interactive mode runs through `session.prompt()` — the same path as typed input — so the prompt template expands and runs on startup.
- Reopen a closed peer tab with `/worktree-open <issue>` (or `scripts/worktree-open.sh <issue>`).
  Creation refuses an existing worktree by design, so `/worktree` is not the command for this; its refusal names the reopen script.
  The reopened session runs `pi --approve --continue`, which resumes that peer's own conversation — Pi keys sessions by directory, so `--continue` inside the worktree needs no picker.
  It validates and spawns only: no branch creation, no `pnpm install`, and it aborts loudly if the directory is missing or is no longer a registered git worktree rather than silently re-creating it.
- Tear down with `scripts/worktree-rm.sh <issue> [--delete-branch]`.

Convergence (the two-session ship flow):

The trunk `/ship-issue` assumes linear `main` and breaks for a worktree branch, so the convergence is split across the peer and root sessions:

1. Peer session — `/sync-worktree <N>`: run pre-push checks, write a **sync** stage note (committed on the branch so it rides the land), then `git fetch origin` + `git rebase origin/main`.
   The peer never touches `main`, never pushes the branch, never force-pushes — worktrees share the same `.git`, so the root sees the branch ref directly.
   The peer writes only stage breadcrumbs (planning/TDD/sync); the deliberate, interactive final `/retro` does not run here.
2. Root session — `/ship-worktree <N>`: `git merge --ff-only <branch>` into `main`, push, verify CI, `issue_close`, then release.
   If the ff-merge is not a fast-forward (another peer landed first), the peer re-runs `/sync-worktree <N>` to rebase onto the new `origin/main`.
3. Release is the root's responsibility — peers never dispatch one, and the workflow's `release` concurrency group serializes runs regardless.
   It honors the plan's `**Release:**` marker: `mid-batch — defer` simply does not name that package.
4. `/ship-worktree` ends by running `scripts/worktree-rm.sh <N> --delete-branch`, then names `/retro <N>` as the final step.
5. Root session — `/retro <N>`: the deliberate, interactive final retrospective, run at the root on `main` after the land (commits straight to `main`, no branch needed) — mirroring the trunk flow's terminal `/retro`.
   Run it on your preferred model; the stage breadcrumbs from the peer session are already on `main` for it to synthesize.

Guardrails:

- Partition work by package — one package per peer.
  Two peers touching `pnpm-lock.yaml` or the same package's source is the main parallel-work hazard.
- `/ship-issue` is trunk-only; ship a worktree branch with `/sync-worktree` (peer) + `/ship-worktree` (root), never `/ship-issue`.
- Whoever lands second rebases first: if `/ship-worktree`'s ff-merge fails, the peer re-runs `/sync-worktree` to rebase onto the new `origin/main` (a non-linear merge into `main` is rejected by design).
- Land a pending worktree branch before committing unrelated work to `main`.
  An intervening root commit to `main` stales the peer's completed `/sync-worktree` rebase, so the ff-merge is rejected and the peer must re-rebase (Refs #549).
  An **unpushed** root commit is the sharper form — the peer rebases onto `origin/main`, cannot see it, and its rebase is a no-op, so it cannot self-correct.
  `git pull --ff-only` hides this (`Already up to date.`, exit 0, when local is merely *ahead*): check `git rev-list --count origin/main..main`, and predict the ff-merge with `git merge-base --is-ancestor main <branch>` (Refs #815).
- A first launch in each worktree reinstalls `.pi/npm/` (gitignored, so it does not carry over) — a one-time cost Pi handles automatically.

###### Session naming convention

Each prompt template calls `set_session_name` (from `pi-session-tools`) to label the session automatically:

| Stage                | Session name format            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| PR review            | `#N PR Review — <title>`       |
| Planning             | `#N Planning — <title>`        |
| TDD implementation   | `#N TDD — <title>`             |
| Build implementation | `#N Build — <title>`           |
| Shipping             | `#N Ship — <title>`            |
| Worktree sync (peer) | `#N Sync (worktree) — <title>` |
| Worktree ship (root) | `#N Ship (worktree) — <title>` |
| Retrospective        | `#N Retrospective — <title>`   |

Each prompt template sets the appropriate name automatically via `set_session_name`.

###### Retro file format

Get each stage timestamp from `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` — never write one from memory; a model has no clock (Refs #653).

Retro files use YAML frontmatter and accumulate `## Stage:` entries:

````markdown
---
issue: 42
issue_title: "Extract ExtensionPaths value object"
---

# Retro: #42 — Extract ExtensionPaths value object

### Diagnostic details

- **Model-performance correlation** — Explore subagent ran on claude-sonnet-4-20250514; appropriate for read-only codebase search.
- **Escalation-delay tracking** — 8 consecutive tool calls on the same lint error in TDD step 3 before switching approach.
- **Feedback-loop gap analysis** — `pnpm run check` ran only after step 6; should have run after step 4 (interface change).
````

The `### Diagnostic details` subsection is optional — include it only when the `/retro` prompt's diagnostic lenses produce actionable findings.
Omit it when all lenses find nothing notable.

###### Pre-completion reviewer

The `pre-completion-reviewer` agent (`.pi/agents/pre-completion-reviewer.md`) is dispatched automatically by `/tdd-plan` and `/build-plan` after all implementation steps are complete.
It runs as a fresh-context subagent (no implementation bias) and produces a PASS / WARN / FAIL report covering: deterministic checks (`pnpm run check`, `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test`, `pnpm fallow dead-code`), acceptance criteria verification, conventional commits, documentation staleness, code design, test artifacts, Mermaid diagrams, cross-step invariant preservation (a later phase step must not regress an earlier step's documented `Outcome:` invariant), and planned follow-up filing (a follow-up the plan names must carry a recorded issue number).
The `pre-completion` skill (`.pi/skills/pre-completion/SKILL.md`) encodes the dispatch protocol loaded by both templates.
The agent's `model:` frontmatter must use the `provider/id` alias form the Pi CLI/UI accepts (e.g. `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`); an ID absent from the model registry silently falls back to the parent session's model.

###### Craftsmanship subagents

Two read-only subagents carry the micro / craftsmanship lens (SOLID at the method scale, Test-Driven **Design**, self-documenting code) so it is examined systematically rather than left to whoever has spare context:

- `tidy-first-assessor` (`.pi/agents/tidy-first-assessor.md`) — dispatched during `/plan-issue` via the `tidy-first` skill (`.pi/skills/tidy-first/SKILL.md`), after the design is settled and before the plan is written.
  It reads the files the change will touch and proposes preparatory `refactor:`/`test:` commits that shrink the change (make the change easy, then make the easy change).
  Advisory; the planning agent triages them into the plan's TDD Order, so the implementing session executes them as ordinary steps and runs no second assessment.
  Planning is the dispatch point because the plan is what must absorb the answer — an assessment arriving at implementation time can only contradict a frozen plan, and a contradiction it reports (a function that does not exist, a call-site count that is off) is a correction to the design while the design is still cheap to change.
  Strictly change-scoped — it must not propose tidying code the change will not touch; rejections are recorded under `#### Deferred tidyings` in the Planning stage note for `/plan-improvements` to sweep.
- `craftsmanship-scout` (`.pi/agents/craftsmanship-scout.md`) — dispatched during `/plan-improvements` discovery (Step 5).
  It **opens** (does not grep) the largest test files and sweeps method-level design, naming, and test-code quality (taxonomy Category G) into a scored debt inventory, flagging each cluster concentrated vs. scattered.
  The concentrated/scattered split drives the deferral gate: concentrated debt in a hot area is a legitimate craftsmanship lean phase; scattered trivia defers to the `tidy-first` boy-scout path.

Both use the same `provider/id` model-alias rule as the reviewer above.

Use `/retro-note` to capture quick observations mid-session without interrupting the workflow.
Use `scripts/issue-context.sh <N>` to gather all available context for an issue (plan, retro, commits, branches) when bootstrapping a new session.

##### Code Style

This project uses **pnpm** exclusively — never `npm` or `npx`.
Before implementing, refactoring, or reviewing code, load the `code-design` skill — it covers naming, SOLID and structural design heuristics, TypeScript conventions, pnpm/ES2024 tooling rules, Pi SDK boundaries, and Biome/ESLint conflict workarounds.

##### Shell and search

Use `colgrep` for intent-based codebase exploration and convention discovery; use `grep` for exact symbol matching.
`rg -r` is `--replace`, not `--recursive` — `rg -rn pattern path` silently rewrites every match to `n` and drops the line numbers.
`rg` recurses by default; drop the `-r` (Refs #725).
Quote a glob pattern meant for a command rather than the shell — `--include='*.ts'`, `find . -name '*.ts'`.
Unquoted, it expands against the cwd first: bash silently substitutes a matched filename, and zsh aborts with `no matches found`.
In zsh an unquoted parameter is not word-split, so `perl -pi -e '…' $FILES` passes the whole list as a single filename — spell a multi-file list inline.
Do not start a bash word with `=` — zsh's `equals` expansion reads `=word` as a command-path lookup, so a decorative `echo ===` separator aborts with `zsh:1: == not found` and discards the rest of an `A; B; C` chain.
Use `echo ---`.
Each `bash` call runs in a fresh shell — a variable set in one call is unset in the next.
Chain producer and consumer in one call, or re-derive the value (Refs #772).
A `gh issue comment` / `gh pr comment` body containing backticks or fences belongs in a file passed with `--body-file` — inside single quotes a `` \` `` ships literally (Refs #794).
A shell snippet quoted inside a `/* */` block comment must not contain `*/` — a `sed 's/,.*//'` closes the comment and breaks the file's parse.
Use `cut -d, -f1`.
Pass file tool paths repo-relative (`packages/<pkg>/src/x.ts`), not hand-built absolute ones — a mistyped absolute path trips the `external_directory` gate instead of failing fast (Refs #726).
Before making an existing prose convention machine-read (a grep-able heading, tag, or marker), enumerate its existing spellings first.
A hand-written convention drifts — `Open-issue sweep dispositions` had three spellings across two packages' archives (Refs #767).
When re-verifying a count established earlier in the session, re-run the original command — do not re-derive it with a new pattern.
A looser one (`rg -l` for an anchored `rg -c '^…'`) admits prose mentions and overturns a correct number (Refs #843).
Do not spend a tool call measuring the shape of a deterministic command's own output — `git rev-parse` emits exactly 40 hex characters, so `| wc -c` on it tests git, not your work.
Re-resolve the identifiers you *typed*, which is the only place a wrong value can enter (Refs #839).

##### Markdown

Before writing or editing markdown files, load the `markdown-conventions` skill — it covers the formatting rules (one-sentence-per-line, fence languages, list numbering, table style) and the YAML frontmatter schema for plans and retros.

##### Mermaid

Before authoring or reviewing Mermaid diagrams, load the `mermaid` skill.

##### Testing

Before writing or debugging tests, load the `testing` skill for Vitest mock patterns and TDD planning rules.

##### Commits

Use Conventional Commits.
Type a commit by what a user can observe once it lands, not by what it adds to the tree.
A module no code imports yet is `refactor:` however new it is; the commit that wires it up carries the `feat:`/`fix:` (Refs #710, #744).
For a breaking change, place the `!` **after** the scope: `fix(pkg)!:` / `feat(pkg)!:` — never `fix!(pkg):`, which the grammar rejects, so the commit is dropped and the major bump skipped (Refs #452).
The `!` carries the major bump even on a type that is otherwise skipped from the changelog, such as `refactor(pkg)!:` — `protect_breaking_commits` in `cliff.toml` is what preserves that; do not remove it (Refs #865).
A `commit-msg` hook runs [`committed`](https://github.com/crate-ci/committed) (wired via `prek`, installed by `pnpm install`) and enforces this deterministically: a malformed header fails locally before it can mis-version a release (Refs #457, #468).
When a `prek` hook fails to **install** (a network error building the hook env — e.g. `uv` fetching `setuptools`, not a lint/grammar failure), it blocks the commit without having run any check.
Run the equivalent gate manually (`pnpm exec rumdl check`, `pnpm run lint`) and, once clean, commit with `--no-verify`.
This applies only to a hook *install* failure — a hook that runs and *reports* a violation is a real gate; fix it, never `--no-verify` past it.
Commit at meaningful checkpoints without waiting for an explicit reminder.
Prefer small, reviewable commits that leave the repository in a valid state.
Do not gate a commit (or any `&&` step) on a check piped through `tail`/`head` — a pipeline's exit status is the filter's, so a failed `pnpm run lint`/`check` is masked and the commit still runs.
Run the check unpiped, or test `${PIPESTATUS[0]}`.
To keep the output short without losing the gate, redirect rather than pipe: `pnpm run check >/tmp/check.log 2>&1 || tail -30 /tmp/check.log`.
That redirect hides Biome findings at **warning** level, which exit 0 — `pnpm run lint` reports PASS while new warnings accumulate.
After adding or heavily editing files, count them: `pnpm run lint >/tmp/l.log 2>&1; grep -c 'lint/' /tmp/l.log || true` — `grep -c` exits 1 on a zero count (Refs #694).
`biome check --write` reports `No fixes applied` for a warning, whose fix is unsafe-classified — hand-edit it, or `--write --unsafe` the one file.
When a shell loop or script needs a status variable, do not name it `status` — zsh reserves `$status` (an alias for `$?`) as read-only, so the assignment aborts with `read-only variable: status`; use `state`/`rc` instead.
Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` — `scripts/release/prepare-release.sh` owns it, splicing each release in below the header.
Do not name an unreleased version in docs — git-cliff assigns it at release time, so a number written during implementation is a guess. (`./scripts/release/next-version.sh <pkg>` will tell you what it would be, but that answer moves with every commit until the release runs.) Describe the condition instead: "a version that predates the heartbeat", not "older than 25.2.0" (Refs #721).
The same applies to an unfiled issue number: file the follow-up first, then write back the number the API returned — a guessed `#N` is off by however many issues landed since (Refs #610).
The same applies to a commit SHA: resolve every one you publish with `git rev-parse` — including the second and third hash cited mid-draft, which is where the invention happens (Refs #777).
Before pricing a rename of this repo's own export as breaking, check whether it has shipped.
Read the file at the published tag: `pnpm view @gotgenes/<pkg> version`, then `git show <pkg>-v<version>:<path>`.
Never `.pi/npm/node_modules/` — it is only as fresh as the last `pi update --extensions`, so a stale copy hides an export that already shipped.
An export that exists only on unreleased `main` renames for free (Refs #789, #794).
The same read answers what the published code *does*, not only whether a symbol exists — #810 priced its wire change on the shipped reader's own tolerance of a missing field.
A type reachable from the published declaration bundle is as breaking as a named export: `ForwardedSessionApproval` is exported by no name, but a third-party `Authorizer` link receives it through `PromptPermissionDetails` (Refs #810).
Before naming a remediation in a breaking-change migration note (CLI flag, config key, API call), verify it exists in the real surface (SDK types, `--help`, schema) — do not infer a config key by analogy.
The note ships to the `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, the generated CHANGELOG, and the issue close comment.
Do not put `Closes #N` / `Fixes #N` / `Resolves #N` in commit messages.
`/ship-issue` posts a curated close comment (implemented-in SHA, behavior summary) via `issue_close`; a commit keyword auto-closes the issue on push and pre-empts that comment, leaving the issue with no summary.
Reference issues as `(#N)` in the subject or `Refs #N` in the body instead.
Still separate footer tokens (`Refs #N`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) from the body with a blank line for readability; it is not enforced — `committed` validates only the header grammar and parses a body-line `#N` correctly, so the `conventional-commits-parser` footer false positive that motivated the swap no longer applies (Refs #468).
Put `Co-authored-by:` in the **final** paragraph, below `Refs #N` — git reads only the last paragraph as trailers, and `Refs #N` (no colon) is not trailer-shaped, so a co-author line above it is invisible to GitHub attribution.
Verify with `git interpret-trailers --parse` (Refs #710).
When a commit-lint or format gate fires a false positive, disable the single offending check (the specific `committed.toml` field), not the whole gate.
Avoid `git rebase -i` in this environment — `$EDITOR` opens an interactive editor that aborts non-interactively.
Reorder or fix unpushed commits with `git reset` + re-commit, or set `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR`/`EDITOR=true`.
A scripted rebase reports `Successfully rebased` even when the sequence editor matched nothing and every line replayed as `pick` — this git writes its todo as `pick <sha> # <subject>`.
Verify by diffing the subjects, and confirm the content is untouched with `git diff <backup-tag> HEAD` (Refs #710).
After `git reset --soft HEAD~N`, all N commits' changes are staged together — to re-split into separate commits, run `git reset` (mixed) first, then `git add` per commit.
A commit a pre-commit hook rejected never moved `HEAD`, so a following `git reset --soft HEAD~1` undoes the *previous* commit — confirm with `git log -1` first (Refs #866).
`git checkout <ref> -- <path>` as the swap in an A/B measurement destroys uncommitted work: the restore half (`git checkout HEAD -- <path>`) restores HEAD, which is the *previous* commit while the current step is still uncommitted.
Back both sides up as files first — `cp` the working state aside, `git show <ref>:<path> >` the baseline — and swap with `cp` in both directions; never lead the restore with `rm -rf <path>`, which the permission gate denies mid-command and leaves a partial tree (Refs #742).
Staged deletions from `git rm` ride along with the next `git commit` even when you `git add` only unrelated paths — commit with an explicit pathspec (`git commit -- <paths>`) or check `git status` first.
Before `git commit --amend`, confirm HEAD is your own commit (`git log -1`) — a concurrent session may have committed since yours, and amend rewrites whatever HEAD points at.
